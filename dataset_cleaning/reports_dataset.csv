Similar scenarios are also projected by major UN partners in the country, as well as independent experts, with the seasonal flood extent minimum reached in May, which was similar to the minima of recent seasons and the above-average rainfall in South Sudan will likely feed itself into the flood extent and reduce evaporation losses.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 65,000 people have been displaced, with over 41,000 in Warrap State alone. The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated $10 million to aid 700,000 flood-affected people in five severely impacted counties. The South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) allocated $5 million to complement this effort. ([OCHA, 12 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093561))

Flooding has affected over 890,000 people across the country. The latest increase is attributed to newly confirmed numbers of affected people in the Abyei Administrative Area, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes states. About 226,000 people are flood-displaced, including 114,480 reported from Unity State alone. Due to damaged and impassable roads, physical access to affected communities remains a challenge.

Hurricane Beryl - Jun 2024,"Tropical cyclone Beryl has become a major hurricane forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane headed toward the Windward Islands (Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Martinique). On 29 June evening, Beryl was about 960 km/h east-southeast of Barbados with maximum sustained winds of near 136 km/h, moving west at around 30 km/h. Maximum sustained winds of 129 – 177 km/h or greater, rainfall accumulations of 100 to 150mm, very rough and hazardous marine conditions and storm surges are expected across St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with possible higher winds offshore. Large and destructive waves/swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. The government of St Vincent and the Grenadines has urged the population to gather emergency supplies. Shelters are to be accessible by 6 p.m. local time today. Volunteers are active in their various communities, checking the vulnerable population and assisting families preparing for the event.

Hurricane Beryl, the earliest hurricane to reach category five intensity in the Atlantic Ocean, has caused unprecedented devastation across the Caribbean, making its destructive path through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Dominica, Barbados, and Jamaica...The storm first impacted Barbados, causing severe damage to the south coast and significantly affecting the fishing industry, with over 200 fishing vessels damaged or destroyed. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, 90 percent of infrastructure has been damaged, including houses, roads, and the airport terminal on Union Island. Communication with the Southern Grenadines remains disrupted, and access to basic services is still limited...While in Grenada, Beryl made landfall in Carriacou as a Category 4 hurricane, damaging 95 percent of homes in Carriacou and Petite Martinique. ([IFRC, 4 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4075316))

According to the 5 July Government Gazette, the parishes of Saint Patrick, Carriacou and Petite Martinique have been declared disaster zones from 1 July to 30 September 2024. The Damage and Needs Assessment (DANA) team confirmed that all data for Grenada should be finalized by 16 July. Currently, only the assessment for St. David is pending completion. Road blockages and assessment fatigue among residents are causing delays. The full extent of damage in Mayreau and Canouan remains unknown due to telecommunication issues, but similarly severe damage is expected. Bequia in the northern Grenadines sustained less damage. As Mayreau is far from the mainland, it is accessible only by a two-hour boat trip from St. Vincent. Although some aid is expected to trickle in from nearby islands, needs are widespread, and the aid is only guaranteed for the short term. An estimated 1,000 people remain in public shelters, a figure that does not account for those in private homes. ([OCHA, 9 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4076720))

The Government, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), UN agencies, and international organizations are working together to provide essential services, medical care, and support rebuilding efforts. Both countries face challenges in logistics, resource allocation, and rebuilding to withstand future hurricanes, especially with the peak of hurricane season approaching. Both Governments are prioritizing restarting the economy and improving disaster preparedness while addressing immediate needs and long-term recovery.

Nepal: Floods and Landslides - Jun 2024,"Flood is the most severe of the hazards observed in Nepal in terms of physical and socioeconomic losses and destruction. Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai's vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions. ([IFRC, 12 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4069831))

The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali, frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period. People living along these rivers especially low-lying areas, informal settlements, fragile houses, and those who have low-income status and a number of dependent family members to care for, are highly vulnerable to flooding; especially during the monsoon (June to September).

Guatemala: Dengue Outbreak - May 2024,"Dengue continues to be the arbovirus with the highest number of reported cases in the Americas region, with outbreaks occurring on a cyclical basis every 3 to 5 years. During the year 2024 between epidemiological weeks (SE, for its acronym in Spanish) 1 and 16 of 2024, a total of 6,769,140 suspected cases of dengue were reported (cumulative incidence of 717 cases per 100,000 population). This ígure represents an increase of 206% compared with the same period in 2023 and 387% compared with the average for the last 5 years (1).  
On 16 February 2024, in view of the exponential increase in dengue cases observed in the írst weeks of the year in several countries of the Region of the Americas, PAHO made an urgent appeal to Member States. The organization emphasized the need to intensify vector control measures and to maintain active surveillance, ensuring early diagnosis and timely treatment of cases (2).  
On 7 March 2024, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS, for its acronym in Spanish) of Guatemala, through the Directorate of Epidemiology and Risk Management, issued an epidemiological alert for dengue (3). This alert was established to reinforce dengue control and prevention plans, based on data accumulated up to epidemiological week 7, which ended on 17 February. As of that date, a total of 6,760 cases of dengue fever had been recorded this year, of which 31 were severe cases resulting in 3 deaths. The decision to issue this alert was motivated by the beginning of the high dengue transmission season in the country. As part of this measure, specific epidemiological surveillance actions were reinforced, including standardized protocols for the detection, notiícation, and registration of cases in hospitals and health areas.

Reports indicate that the impact of these dry conditions in Southern Africa is likely to be long-lasting, with FEWS NET projections indicating the possibility of elevated needs for food assistance during the lean season in early 2025. ([IFRC, 14 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4070454))

An estimated 1.0 to 1.5 million people in Angola will likely need humanitarian food assistance by January 2025, primarily in south and east Angola, which have experienced repeated droughts, particularly in the provinces of Cunene, Cuando Cubango, Moxico, and parts of Namibe and Huila. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely in these areas.
Many households in the rest of the country will likely experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes through January 2025 due to more favorable rainfall driving relatively better harvest prospects and labor opportunities from land preparation, weeding, and planting.

Botswana: Drought - May 2024,"On May 24, 2024, the Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development issued a report urging support due to the devastating impact of drought on food security drivers, nutrition, water supplies, and food production. The report highlighted a signicant decline in crop yields, with a drop from 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22 to 125,184 tons in 2022/23. Cereal production in 2022/23 reached only 67,530 tons, which is equivalent to just 23% of the national requirement. The 2022/23 cropping season experienced low and highly erratic rainfall, along with extended dry periods, severely impacting food and agricultural production, disrupting urban water supplies, and damaging the rural economy and socio-cultural structures. As a result, the nation is experiencing signicant chronic food insecurity, with over 10% of the population facing food and nutrition problems.
The country has experienced dry spells and rainfall decits in recent years, leading the government to declare a drought emergency in July 2023. This marks the third consecutive year of severe drought, affecting arable agricultural land in a context where 70% of the rural population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, primarily through rain-fed farming. Since then, 163,000 people have been categorized as food insecure. The SADC Synthesis Report on The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa indicated that 37,000 individuals in Botswana are experiencing food insecurity in 2024.
The El Niño drought effect in Southern Africa has further exacerbated the already critical drought situation. According to the Southern Africa Seasonal Monitor report, Botswana is currently experiencing El Niño conditions, leading to severe rain deficits and challenging harvest conditions across most of the region, with dry spells expected to persist.

The Ministry of Blue Economy and Disaster Risk Management informed that the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) had been responding to reports of wildfires affecting the village of San Pedro Columbia and adjacent communities in the Toledo District. Initial assessments were conducted, and a plan of action was created to provide immediate humanitarian support to affected families. NEMO maintained contact with the chairpersons and alcaldes of San Pedro Columbia, Crique Jute, Mafredi, and San Antonio. Aerial reconnaissance was conducted on May 17th to confirm the extent of the fire, determine the initial damage assessment, and assist in plans to contain the fire. Based on this initial assessment and as a result of the wildfires affecting the community of San Pedro Columbia and adjacent communities in the Toledo District, the Ministry of Blue Economy and Disaster Risk Management and the NEMO informed that a proclamation declaring a state of public emergency for the district was signed by the Governor General on May 19. On May 20, the Government of Belize halted classes in localities of the country that had been affected by forest fires and suffered heavy environmental pollution due to this cause. The Ministry of Education declared the measure for all schools in the Toledo district and considered the action necessary due to the poor air quality in that area. Several local media reports document the extent of damage the fires have caused within the Toledo District. According to two media outlets, around one hundred farmers have lost their entire farms. The fires that swept through several communities in the Toledo District have left significant losses in their wake. The fires became a threat to the communities as they threatened farms in several Maya villages, starting in San Pedro, Columbia. The Belize Defense Force’s Cadenas Outpost near Graham Creek had also been consumed by the fires. Deputy Commander of the Belize Defense Force, Colonel Anthony Velasquez said the soldiers had to abandon the post. These media reports are supported by the ongoing needs assessment being conducted by the national authorities, which states that “the main effects in the Toledo District were loss of livelihoods and crops, temporary displacement, inconvenience, and respiratory health issues.

Namibia: Drought - May 2024,"On 22 May, the Government of Namibia declared the State of Emergency following the worst drought that the country has experienced in 100 years. According to media reports, every one in five Namibians is considered food insecure. Against the backdrop of scarce rains, over 331,000 households have already registered for the government-funded drought relief programme to assist the affected communities. This programme amounts to EUR 40 million but it currently has a funding gap of EUR 25 million. At the extraordinary summit held on 20 May by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to discuss the El Niño-induced drought and floods affecting member states, the Namibian President called for assistance from SADC countries and the International Community at large to bridge the above-mentioned funding gap. ([ECHO, 29 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065957))

Between April and June 2024, an estimated 1.2 million people (40 percent of the analysed population) in Namibia face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods. These are the most vulnerable groups (unemployed, marginalized communities, those with no national documents to benefit from social safety nets, children under the age of five, pregnant and breastfeeding women and pensioners) in both urban and rural areas. This number has more than doubled from 491,000 people (19 percent of the population analysed) which were projected to be facing acute food insecurity during the period under review in the July 2023 analysis.The entire country (all 14 regions) is classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and need action for livelihood protection. Namibia’s deteriorating food security is mainly driven by the impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, climatic shocks, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. ([IPC, 8 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4076162))

During the current period of analysis, from July to September 2024, 1.15 million people in Namibia (38 percent of the analysed population) face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods; all the 14 areas of analysis are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). This represents an improvement compared to what was projected in the last July 2023 analysis, where 1.44 million people (48 percent) were expected to face high levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) for the same period (July-September 2024). While the main assumption on the impact of El Nino was adjusted, the deterioration of the food security situation is still linked to the negative impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. In the first projection period (October 2024 – March 2025), the food security situation is expected to worsen due to the start of the lean season, and seasonal price increases, where 1.26 million people (41 percent of the analysed population) are expected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above.

Mozambique: Drought - May 2024,"As vast parts of southern Africa grapple with an unprecedented mid-season dry spell, the food security situation in Mozambique continues to deteriorate. The compounded effects of El Niño, above-average temperatures, extreme weather events such as Tropical Storm Filipo, excessive floods, coupled with the lasting impact of past shocks such as Tropical Cyclone Freddy, are exacerbating the situation. The 2023-2024 El Niño has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces. ([IFRC, 27 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065342))

Around 20 million people reside in areas that have now been hit by drought, 2.7 million of whom were already struggling with food insecurity (IPC3+) before the onset of El Niño. DG ECHO contributed EUR 200,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Emergency Appeal, aiming to support the Mozambique Red Cross in its response to the drought and food insecurity in the country.

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to prevail from June to September 2024 in the El Niño-induced drought and conflict-affected areas of Mozambique due to poor harvests, limited income-earning opportunities, and failure to engage in normal livelihoods activities. In addition to these shocks, above-average food prices will make it difficult for poor and very poor households to access food from the markets. In Cabo Delgado, several areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance will likely be facing Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand
between October 2024 and January 2025, mainly in the country's central region. The impact of the lean season, which includes the rapid depletion of below-average food stocks for families who were able to harvest some of their own crops, combined with above-average food prices and below average income, will lead to an expansion of areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, particularly in areas affected by the El Niño-induced drought.

**Bangladesh** has recently undergone civil unrest and turmoil, compounding the already existing humanitarian situation that resulted from the recent Cyclone Remal [...] and the floods in the northeastern parts of the country [...]. The situation has impacted the well-being and lives of millions of children, women, and the entire population. Response efforts are being hindered by disrupted logistics, communication breakdowns, and coordination issues, leading to delays in delivering water and essential supplies such water purification tablets, education in emergency kits (EIE kits) and dignity kits. Violence and unrest resulted in roadblocks and curfews, restricting access to affected areas and delaying the provision of emergency services. The safety of humanitarian workers is at risk, further limiting their ability to assist, while increased anxiety, fear and mental stress have reduced attendance at awareness sessions and impacted health services seeking by communities.

The declaration and ensuing water restrictions was prompted by a combination of prolonged drought conditions, insufficient rainfall, and aging water infrastructure. Collectively, this led to critically low water levels in reservoirs. The government implemented several emergency measures to manage the crisis and mitigate its impacts on the population. The 2024 water crisis in Grenada is noted as the most severe in 14 years. This crisis is marked by unprecedented low water levels, significant water rationing, and stringent restrictions on water usage for non-essential activities. The declaration highlighted the extreme nature of the drought and the urgent need for conservation and improved water management strategies to ensure the availability of safe drinking water for the island's residents. ([IFRC, 24 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4064984/))

Although recent rains have slightly alleviated the situation, water supplies remain insufficient. Farmers are struggling with dry conditions, leading to crop failures and food shortages. Meanwhile, a heatwave has worsened conditions, causing bush fires and exacerbating water shortages. In response, the Grenada Red Cross, supported by the IFRC, is working with the National Water and Sewage Authority to assist the affected population. Despite immediate relief efforts, the water crisis is expected to persist until the peak of the next rainy season.

Angola: Polio Outbreak - May 2024,"In the week of May 3rd, 2024, Angolan health authorities announced that polio had been detected in Chitato Municipality, Lunda Norte province, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A person infected with 'circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2' (cVDPV2) was confirmed. Although a polio outbreak had already been declared by the government on February 27th, 2024, due to environmental samples found in the provinces of Luanda and Huambo, the case on May 3rd was the first human case reported. The Government of Angola has classified the current outbreak as a Grade 2 emergency (i.e., moderate level – aligned with WHO classification) due to the high risk of virus spread, exacerbated by poor water and sanitation infrastructure and hard-to-reach populations. Additionally, there is an increased risk of cross-border transmission along the DRC-Angola border, with genetic sequencing indicating a link to a polio virus reported in the DRC's Cassai Oriental province, classified as cVDPV2 (Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Type 2).

The landslide buried one school, and 10 other nearby schools (eight elementary and two primary) were also affected. Health services have been restored in two primary health facilities. The two Care Centers established in Wabag and Mulatika will be developed to host increased displaced populations. Damage to a major road is impeding fuel and food supplies from Wabag to landslide-affected areas. The security situation in the disaster area remains volatile due to competition for resources, pre-existing inter-communal tensions and pervasive gender-based violence; the first serious security incident was reported on 13 June.

Following the landslide in Enga Province in May, the Enga Provincial Disaster Office (EPDO) has been alerted to imminent threats at the Mulitaka Landslide area by emergency response and geotechnical teams on site. Assessments indicate ongoing geo-seismic activity and potential hazards threatening communities within the Mulitaka Landslide Disaster Site and the Disaster Management Emergency Care Center. Bulges, cracks on the road and fault lines on the high ground have been observed, indicating the imminent risk of further landslides. Immediate evacuation and resettlement of the Care Center are recommended. The Enga Provincial Disaster Office (EPDO) issued the new direction to be immediately implemented for the Provincial Disaster Management Committee (PNGDF), Police, and UN agencies to coordinate evacuations, restrict access to the site, and identify new settlement areas. ([OCHA, 26 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4072993/))

The landslide caused extensive damage to many lives, homes and livelihoods. The extent of the destruction has left an estimated 1,680 individuals displaced, with an estimated 3,979 individuals affected and at risk of displacement. Furthermore; 9,952 individuals are estimated to be directly affected by the landslide. Immediate emergency response and long-term recovery plans are crucial to address the needs of these affected populations and mitigate future risks and vulnerabilities. The landslide has not only devastated the Yambali ward but also caused significant instability in the surrounding area. The soil remains highly unstable, with visible cracks indicating imminent threats to lives and properties. Ongoing geo-seismic activities in the vicinity exacerbate the risk, as the land continues to shift. The landslide covered two creeks with debris and boulders, blocking waterways and increasing the likelihood of further slides. The blockage of these creeks poses a critical risk of flooding, which could trigger additional landslides, endangering the already vulnerable community.

Lesotho: Drought - Apr 2024,"According to the weather update for quarter 1 of 2024 issued by the Lesotho Meteorological Services, the persistent heatwaves and exceptionally high temperatures experienced between January and March 2024 have led to widespread dryness of crops across most fields. The continuous crop failures over the past seasons is exacerbated. The past two quarters have seen the same crop failure leading automatically to the high food prices. There are 41% of rural families spending more than half of their income on food while most of the families leave with low income. In two consecutive agricultural seasons (2021/2022 and 2022/2023), Lesotho experienced harsh climatic induced shocks such as hailstorms, pests and heavy rainfall/waterlogging in most parts of the country. On the other hands, the heavy rainfalls in late December 2023 and early 2024 led to waterlogged fields which resulted in crop failure. The inflation resulting from this crop failures or production failures have a direct incidence to the families already struggling with low income and other factors that make them more vulnerable to food insecurity. Approximately, 325,000 individuals are experiencing the ramifications of the ongoing food insecurity based on IPC information, stemming from the enduring drought that has gripped the nation for years and increased the food insecurity situation. This figure represents approximately 22% of the population. Eight districts on the ten in Lesotho are under Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 3 (IPC3), signifying a crisis state. Berea, Maseru, Mafeteng, Mohale’s Hoek, Quthing, Thaba Tseka, and Leribe areas. In these districts, access to adequate food and nutrition is severely compromised, necessitating urgent intervention and support measures to alleviate the hardship faced by affected communities.

A below-normal harvest and increased market reliance have resulted in maize prices rising during the main harvest. Although a larger area was planted in the 2023/24 than the previous season, dry conditions damaged much of the crop between January and March, especially maize. Some poor and very poor households that experienced significant crop losses are already relying on food purchases from local markets, which is earlier than normal. Retail staple food prices are expected to increase further due to below-average local production and higher prices for imported maize. Consequently, household purchasing capacity is expected to decline, particularly between August and September, when market purchases are the main food source, and labor opportunities are often seasonally limited. Overall, most households are likely to continue to meet their food needs through September, driving area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes.

In April 2024, the Eastern Uganda-Elgon region experienced heavy rainfall, as forecasted by the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA). This resulted in significant impacts from episodic floods, hailstorms, and landslides in various areas, including Mbale, Kapchorwa, Bulambuli, Bukedea, Butaleja, Sironko, Bududa, and Namisindwa. A total of 18,323 people were affected, including thousands of displaced families, with 1,129 houses and several crop lands and infrastructures completely destroyed. The rains intensified in the first half of May, causing water levels to rise and rivers such as Manafwa, Lwakhakha, Sironko, Mpologoma, Awoja, Nbuyonga, and Namatala to overflow, increasing the water flow from the slopes of Mount Elgon. Unprecedented flooding occurred, especially between May 7th and 11th, exacerbating the impacts experienced throughout April.

Malawi: Drought - Mar 2024,"About nine million people in Malawi are reeling from the devastating impacts of El Niño-induced floods and drought, which are destroying harvests and causing hunger to soar to crisis levels ... An El Niño-induced drought has severely affected this season’s maize harvest, resulting in a forecast 45 percent decline against the five-year average and exacerbating food insecurity, and about 40 percent of the population could be facing acute hunger by the end of year because of the drought. In addition, about 14,000 people were displaced by floods and landslides in the northern part of the country. On 25 March, the President of Malawi declared a national disaster. The National Response Plan launched in April estimates the needs at US$449 million. Similarly, neighbouring countries of Zambia and Zimbabwe have also declared national drought emergencies.

These populations require urgent humanitarian action to reduce their food consumption gaps, protect and restore their livelihoods and prevent high levels of acute malnutrition. An additional 6.7 million people are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) between the same period and require interventions to mitigate disaster risks and safeguard their livelihoods. Most of the population in Phase 3 or above are not able to produce enough of their own food and are dependent on market purchases for their food needs. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate during the projection period from October 2024 to March 2025 which coincides with the lean season in Malawi. The resulting impact of El Niño on crop production will exacerbate the situation further and is likely to result in an earlier onset of the lean season. In this projected period, 5.7 million people (28 percent of the analysed population are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or above).

Lebanon: Cold Wave - Jan 2024,"Lebanon and the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea are currently affected by a low depression accompanied by polar winds, leading to a noticeable drop in temperatures and unstable weather conditions since the start of the winter. From 24 to 29 January 2024, the Met Services released a statement about the escalation of the depression, accompanied by a mass cold wave forming Storm Daniella which led to snowfall with peak impact on 26 January 2024. The storm also caused heavy rainfalls across the country with severe winds and snowfall. There was a heavy decline in the temperature, reaching subzero degrees in mountainous areas and 3 degrees in Bekaa. This storm impacted several governorates in Lebanon specifically mountainous areas in Bekaa, Mount Lebanon, North and South regions.

Marshall Islands: Storm Surge - Jan 2024,"On the night of 22 January 2024, a significant water and wave-related event occurred due to a potent winter storm system in the far northern Pacific. This event primarily impacted the Marshall Islands, particularly the Roi Namur Islet in the northern sector of Kwajalein Atoll, which is part of the US Military base. Notably, this incident involved weather-driven waves and inundation, distinct from a tsunami.

The powerful winds associated with the storm system generated a substantial swell that affected Roi-Namur and other areas such as Arno Atoll and the runway in Ailinglapalap. There are suspicions that additional islands and atolls (namely: Jaluit, Arno, Namu, Alinglaplap, Wotje, Jabot, Namdrik, Kili, Kwajalein) may have been affected, although ground reports are limited and experiencing delays due to communication and infrastructure challenges.

Collectively, a total of 19,532 people live on those islands. In the neighboring Federated State of Micronesia (FSM), islands also encountered inundation, leading to evacuations from coastal areas in Kosrae. According to information from NOAA, this event appears to be more severe than the flood in December 2008 that affected RMI and is comparable to the December 2021 King Tide inundation event across the FSM.

In response to a deadly Hepatitis E outbreak in South Sudan, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched a mass vaccination campaign in collaboration with the Ministry of Health to safeguard women and girls of reproductive age, who are at greatest risk of death from the disease. Since April 2023, 501 cases of Hepatitis E have been treated at the MSF hospital in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, and 21 people have died—mainly women. The fatality can be as high as 40 percent for pregnant women, and there is no cure, meaning that many people with advanced stages of illness do not survive. MSF's vaccination campaign is the first to be conducted during the acute stages of an active Hepatitis E outbreak anywhere in the world. It is made more challenging by the remoteness and isolation of the area of South Sudan where it is taking place. But if the campaign succeeds, it will save lives.

Mongolia: Dzud - Dec 2023,"Mongolia is currently facing a severe Dzud. This slow-onset disaster is unique to Mongolia and results from summer droughts followed by heavy snowfalls and extreme cold, leading to insufficient grazing pastures and hence underfed animals resulting in increased livestock mortality. As of 30th December 2023, over 90% of the country has been affected by extreme Dzud conditions, with 160 soums across 20 provinces being identified as high-risk areas. Over 258,000 people, including 100,000 children (51,000 girls and 49,000 boys) are affected due to roads blocked by snow, preventing children from accessing vital health, nutrition, education and protective services. Herder families, who are most directly impacted by the Dzud, often have to leave their children in the care of relatives or at boarding schools, increasing protection risks and causing psychological stress. ([UNICEF, 25 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4032456))

As a result of the Dzud, the number of livestock losses increased from 49,000 in November 2023 to 284,242 by 26 January 2024. The Otor Movement is a nomadic practice of domestic herders migrating to seek pasture: From early November 2023, 18,859 herder families (67,892 people) have been on the Otor Movement. As of January 2024, 7,570 families moved to the state-protected area (the Mongolian government is using its last pasture resort, where settlement is prohibited because there are endangered plants and animals under State protection), 2,322 families moved to other provinces, 4,303 families moved within their province, 2,907 moved to the border, 1,047 moved to the provincial border (in and out between 2 provinces), and only 710 families moved in soum borders. While the Otor movement is beneficial for livestock, it requires tremendous efforts from herder families to frequently relocate, forcing them to live in roughly built shelters and being isolated from basic services. The intensity of the dzud is impacting those on the Otor Movement more than in previous years, and the number of people on the Otor Movement is higher than in previous years. ([IFRC, 2 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4035085/))

The current white and iron dzud in Mongolia has resulted in a critical situation, with 90% of the country facing high risk. The herding communities are struggling with inadequate feed and skyrocketing feed prices, leading to heightened vulnerabilities. The increasing severity of weather conditions further exacerbates the crisis, underscoring the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable solutions to support Mongolia's rural communities and traditional livelihoods. ([UN RC Mongolia, 6 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4036374/))

According to the national Emergency Operations Center (EOC), there are 13,573 households currently residing in snow blocked areas, as of 18 February 2024. Between November 2023 to February 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 150,500 people, including 62,500 children (31,500 girls and 31,000 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow. According to EOC, 9 casualties due to snowstorms, including 1 child, have been reported. The number of livestock perished reached 667,841 as of 19 February 2024, which is significantly higher compared to past years’ data. However, the peak of livestock mortality is yet to come and expected to occur from late February to April 2024. ([UNICEF, 21 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4039973/))

As of 22 February, media report one fatality and more than 1.5 million livestock losses across the country. Essential aids have been provided since 19 February. ([ECHO, 23 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4040820/))

[...] The livestock mortality rate reportedly reached 4.8 per cent by 29 February, representing some 3.1 million heads of livestock – nearly a million more livestock deaths than a week ago and nearly 6.5 times as many livestock deaths as this time last year. Livestock deaths are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, potentially exceeding the national-level 6 per cent disaster threshold. At the province (aimag) level, the most severe impacts this season have been recorded in the eastern regions, with four aimags already exceeding the threshold – Sukhbaatar (24.4 per cent), Dornogovi (14.7 per cent), Govisumber (11.2 per cent), and Hentii (9.6 per cent). With around 190,000 herder households grappling with insufficient feed, soaring prices and heightened vulnerabilities, the worsening weather conditions are exacerbating a crisis, highlighting the urgent need for support and sustainable interventions to bolster rural communities and traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. ([OCHA, 5 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4043598/))

[...]  According to the Dzud Map produced by NAMEM on 26 February 2024, 76 per cent of the country is currently affected by white and ice/Iron Dzud types. Several additional key factors have contributed to the escalation of the Dzud to an exceptional level this winter: numerous blizzards since November 2023, extensive snow coverage across the country, and fluctuating temperatures with periods of intense cold/freezing, followed by warm phases/snow melting, and then refreezing, leaving no grazing options for livestock (sheep, cows, horses, and camels). Consequently, hay and fodder stocks had to be utilised a few months earlier than in usual winters. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), established by the government of Mongolia last December, has reported a rapid increase in livestock mortality from the second half of February 2024, with the latest official figures as of 14 March 2024 indicating over 4,7 million dead animals (compared to 612,000 dead animals on 21 February). This represents 7 per cent of the national livestock (up from 0.94 per cent on 21 February). While the numbers are increasing fast, this situation is already twice as critical as last year's Dzud, and the government estimates that this year will be far more severe than the worst Dzud recorded in 2010. On 14 February 2024, the Government of Mongolia passed a resolution declaring a heightened readiness level until 15 May due to the severe Dzud affecting the country nationwide (priority support and involvement in crisis management, at all governmental levels). According to EOC figures, as of the end of February, 185,937 herder households, constituting 75 per cent of all herder households, have been directly or indirectly affected by the Dzud’s impacts. About 100,000 herder families are considered the most vulnerable households. As of 7 March 2024, 1,344 herders have lost their entire livestock, and 18,859 herder families are currently on the Otor movement (a nomadic winter coping mechanism used in past years by herder communities in Mongolia to provide livestock access to pasture). ([IFRC, 15 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4046890/))

Between November 2023 and March 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 114 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 3,757 people, including 721 children, trapped by heavy snow. ([UNICEF, 22 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4048939))

The situation has escalated significantly compared to previous years, with March 2024 witnessing conditions twice as severe as the last dzud event, and the worst since 2010. Current livestock mortality rates have already soared to 8.1% of 64.7 million livestock, with 2,257 herder households having lost more than 70% of their livestock. The severity of the situation has prompted a revision of the Dzud Response Plan for 2023/2024, which complements the Government of Mongolia’s planned response. The plan revised by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) now aims to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance to 76,000 people out of the 200,000 people in need identified by the HCT through a coordinated approach with early warning and early action to respond to needs triggered by the Dzud. ([OCHA, 26 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4049776))

Health concerns are escalating, with restricted food availability leading to nutritional deficiencies among herder households. [...] The remote location of many herder families, combined with a lack of fuel and prioritization of livestock over healthcare, severely limits access to medical services, which are available at the provincial and soum levels. [...] The need to dispose of more than five million animal carcasses is urgent, as yellow floods are expected with spring temperatures set to melt an exceptional amount of snow this year. The government has begun to safely bury animal carcasses through collection points along roads, with areas near rivers being prioritized to contain public health risks. ([IFRC, 4 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4052404))

Between November 2023 and April 2024, Mongolia experienced the harshest dzud in the last fifty years, with severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affecting over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys). Twenty people, including two children, have lost their lives due to severe blizzard. The dzud has mostly affected herder households, whose main/sole income source for livelihood is livestock. As of 25 April 2024, 4957 herder households had lost more than 70 per cent of their livestock and the country has lost 7.1 million livestock, amounting to 11.1 per cent of the total. Despite the temperature beginning to rise and the spring months ahead, dzud conditions persist and the loss of livestock is expected to continue in the coming months. ([UNICEF, 1 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4059029))

Although the severe winter condition subsided, livestock that had been exhausted and starved for long period continued to perish well into May. By mid-May 2024, the number of livestock loss reached 7.2 million, amounting to 11.6 percent of the total. The impact of the dzud impact on the herder households continues to affect the livelihood, mental health, wellbeing, nutritional and education needs of over 24,000 children.  Amid the dzud recovery efforts, there is a high risk of flooding in central and eastern parts of Mongolia, posing increasing challenges for the vulnerable population in flood-prone areas. ([UNICEF, 4 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4068169/))

Official estimates indicate that about 7.9 million heads of livestock perished due to the 2023/24 Dzud, with the highest losses occurring in Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Arkhangai, Tuv and Dornogovi provinces (locally known as aimags) located in the eastern and central parts of the country. The death toll accounts for 12.3 percent of the national herd, significantly exceeding the average mortality rate recorded during the same period in the previous five years and is the highest level since 2010. The loss of livestock has a direct negative effect on the income of a large number of people in the country as over a quarter of the total population is engaged in livestock‑rearing activities. Reduced income and high prices of staple foods are expected to erode the purchasing power of most vulnerable herder households, constraining their access to food.

Dominican Republic: Floods and Landslides - Nov 2023,"Since 17 November, a tropical depression has been bringing heavy rainfall, flooding and landslides to the Dominican Republic. According to the country’s Emergency Operations Centre, the extreme weather has left at least 21 people dead and forced more than 13,000 people to evacuate. At least 15 electricity circuits and 115 aqueducts have been affected, causing disruptions in electricity service for more than 150,000 people and water service for some 1.8 million people. The National Institute of Drinking Water and Sewage and EDESUR are working to restore their respective services in the affected areas. 

According to preliminary reports, more than 1,500 homes, 6 roads and 5 bridges have been affected. Some 19 communities remain cut off due to the overflow of rivers. Fourteen provinces (Pedernales, San Juan, Barahona, Azua, San José de Ocoa, Bahoruco, Independencia, Elías Piña, San Cristóbal, Peravia, Sánchez Ramírez, El Distrito Nacional, Santo Domingo and Duarte) across the country remain at a red alert level due to the risk of further flooding and landslides. Heavy rainfall is forecast to continue through until 20 November. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4016404/))

As of 21 November, severe rains and subsequent flooding have left 24 people dead, displaced nearly 18,000 people, affected 3,500 homes, and cut off some 45 communities. About 1.1 million people are still without access to safe water. [...]  The UN is also helping the Ministry of Health with the procurement of 50,000 cholera vaccine doses after authorities detected 16 cases, 12 among Haitian migrants.

Almost three weeks after intense rainfall and flooding hit the Dominican Republic on 17 and 18 November, a Damage and Needs Assessment conducted in North Santo Domingo and the province of Duarte indicates that populations in the most affected communities require food, clean water, hygiene and sanitation supplies, medicines, and the repair or reconstruction of homes. 

According to estimations from the government’s social protection system (SIUBEN), the flooding affected at least 340,000 people in the provinces of Duarte, Santo Domingo, San José de Ocoa, Barahona, Bahoruco, San Juan de la Maguana, Sánchez Ramírez, Peravia, Azua, Distrito Nacional and San Cristóbal. Some 34 people died, 37,000 were displaced and approximately 7,412 homes were severely damaged. Around 61 per cent of damaged homes were in the province of Duarte, while 13 per cent were in Distrito Nacional and the Santo Domingo province. The agricultural sector also faced significant losses, with extensive damage to crops, greenhouses, and livestock, affecting over 7,000 producers in various provinces. President Luis Abinader estimated the damages to exceed US$460 million (excluding the Ministry of Public Works and Communications' budget).

In the aftermath of the rains, ongoing health crises have continued to escalate. There has been an alarming surge of dengue, with 17,360 suspected cases, including 128 severe cases and 19 deaths this year. Additionally, a confirmed cholera outbreak in Barahona, heavily impacted by the floods, reported 29 cases, contributing to the overall national count of 1,109 suspected cases, 115 confirmed cases, and one death.

According to initial data collected by VRCS, over 46,000 households, representing over 180,000 people, were affected by severe winds, intense rainfall and flooding. An estimated 75 per cent of buildings and houses were destroyed in Priority 1 areas and 50 per cent of buildings and houses were destroyed or damaged in Priority 2 areas. [...] VRCS encountered significant challenges getting to the northern province of Penama as well, and particularly northern and eastern Pentecost, due to damaged or blocked roads and in general response efforts at this stage can only be done by large boats. ([IFRC, 10 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4013911/))

In the immediate aftermath of TC Lola, UNICEF promptly carried out a rapid needs assessment on October 27 in the worst affected provinces of Melampa and Penama. It is estimated that over 28,000 students in these two provinces may face disruptions to their education for the rest of the year, potentially losing over 300 hours of classroom learning. [...] The Education Rapid Assessment findings on November 7 revealed significant damage in 61% of schools in Priority 1 areas, 41% in Priority 2 areas, and 28% in Priority 3 areas. 

[...] Tropical Cyclone Lola has not only affected Vanuatu but also impacted the **Solomon Islands**, specifically in the Temotu province. Tikopia and the Duff Islands have suffered significant damage to education infrastructure, with school buildings and dormitories being particularly affected. Communication with remote areas remains challenging due to the damage to solar and telecommunication towers, leading to reduced services in the affected region. Extensive damage to desalination plants and food crops underscores the urgency to prioritise health, nutrition, and WASH supplies, especially in areas where outbreaks of diarrhoea and dysentery have reportedly claimed four lives on the island of Vanikoro.

Hurricane Otis - Oct 2023,"A new tropical cyclone named Otis formed over the eastern North Pacific Ocean on 22 October and started moving north toward southern Mexico as a tropical storm, strengthening and becoming a hurricane on 24 October in the evening (UTC). Otis made landfall over the area of the coastal City of Acapulco, central Guerrero State, southern Mexico on 25 October around 6.25 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 270 km/h (Cat. 5 Hurricane). Otis is forecast to continue northwestward inland over the central-western Guerrero State on 25-26 October, weakening and becoming a tropical storm.

Otis made landfall over the area of the coastal City of Acapulco, central Guerrero State, southern Mexico on 25 October around 6.25 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 270 km/h (Cat. 5 Hurricane). According to NOAA, there are no hurricanes on record even close to this intensity for this part of Mexico. After the landfall, Otis continued northwestward over the central-western Guerrero State on 25 October, weakening and becoming a tropical storm. After that, it became a tropical depression and dissipated over eastern Michoacan State on 25 October in the evening (UTC). Very heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surges associated with the passage of Otis, caused floods and landslides that have resulted in evacuations and severe damage. WHO PAHO and national authorities report, as of 26 October, 34,522 evacuated families in 631 temporary shelters across the affected area. ([ECHO, 26 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4009402))

The Ministry of Health reports 120 health facilities with some type of damage. Some 80 per cent of hotel infrastructure suffered considerable damage. Assessments of damage to critical infrastructure and access to basic services continue, with 273,844 homes so far reported to be affected to some degree. The Ministry of Welfare has deployed 1,678 evaluators in Acapulco and Coyuca de Benítez, and has so far conducted 20,971 surveys of homes, crops and livestock, as well as small and medium-sized businesses in rural and urban areas. The Government of Guerrero reports 5 temporary shelters with 278 people in Acapulco and 7 temporary shelters with 1,342 people in Coyuca de Benítez. There is still no estimated number of people internally displaced by the hurricane. [...] According to UNICEF, more than 296,000 children and adolescents in the five most affected municipalities are in need of humanitarian assistance and 177,804 students have been affected by the closure of basic education schools in these five municipalities. ([OCHA, 01 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4011123/))

On 31 October 2023, the Government of Mexico published an update on the effects of the passage of Hurricane Otis through the State of Guerrero. There are 58 people reported as missing (52 increase since the 29 October report) and 46 deaths have been reported. Additionally, medical care has been provided for 1,248 instances and there were 293 hospital transfers made. ([PAHO, 02 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4011413/))

As of 5 November, the state government of Guerrero reports 47 people dead (2 more than reported on 31 October) and 48 people still missing. In the municipalities of Acapulco de Juárez and Coyuca de Benítez, 1,488 people are in 12 temporary shelters. UNICEF estimates that 1.07 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 323,000 children. ([OCHA, 07 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4012809/))

According to Mexican authorities, as of 8 November, 47 people were left dead, 32 people are unaccounted for and 3,821 people have been evacuated by commercial airlines. [...] According to preliminary reports, approximately 273,844 homes have been affected, including 50,000 completely destroyed. ([OCHA, 11 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4014010/))

IFRC estimates that a total of 928,252 people were exposed to Hurricane Otis, impacting 848,647 in Acapulco and 79,605 in Coyuca de Benítez. According to the Guerrero State Attorney General's Office, there are 48 people dead and 26 people still missing.

Basic services in Acapulco are being progressively re-established. Two water treatment plants in the municipality of Coyuca de Benítez have cumulatively supplied 115,900 litres of water. [...] Media reports indicate that the Acapulco Chamber of Commerce, Services and Tourism estimates that 63,000 economic units of tourism services in the city will be affected, representing the loss of approximately 180,000 jobs. ([OCHA, 16 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4015480/))

Whilst there are no overall cost estimates for the impact of the hurricane available at time of writing, private market insured losses from Hurricane Otis were estimated to be between $2.5bn and $4.5bn. Just using this amount pertaining to private assets equates to over $35 for each of Mexico’s over 127 million inhabitants; dividing the sum just amongst those affected by the hurricane (a little over 1% of the population) means individual average economic costs around $300, a significant sum in a country where the average income is a little over $12,000 annually. The economic impact in the private sector could have been even bigger but some buildings were not significantly damaged. However, since many were designed to withstand earthquakes, they were heavily affected by the hurricane. Only a few hotels and related tourism infrastructure have re-opened since the storm, meaning vital tourism revenue is foregone, adding to the long-term economic impacts. ([Christian Aid, 27 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4024369/))

Overall losses are estimated at US$ 12 billion, and insured losses at around US$ 4 billion due to the high concentration of hotels in the city. It was the year’s third-costliest loss in terms of overall losses. ([Munich Re, 09 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4039897/))

According to official reports, drinking water services have been re-established in Acapulco and Coyuca de Benítez. However, UNICEF’s field reports have located peripheral communities with persistent WASH needs. Public lighting service was re-established in Acapulco on 18 December 2023, and in Coyuca de Benítez in the second week of January 2024.

In mid-January 2024, the Guerrero Ministry of Education reported that 917 schools had resumed classes, out of 1,509. Given the lack of precise information on which schools have re-opened and which remain closed, there is no estimate on the number of children remaining out of school.

Main humanitarian needs for children persist. Although hospitals and medical units are functioning, gaps on availability of medicines, other medical supplies and staff remain. The prevalence of dengue remains of concern, given the need of more adequate preventive and response interventions. UNICEF's mobile medical unit continues to detect cases of malnutrition among children. In terms of education, a number of schools still
have cleaning needs. In those cases, where schools have opened, material is still needed including books, uniforms, furniture, etc. As reported by staff
who have visited social assistance centers, concerns remain regarding the psychological impact of the disaster on affected children. The mid/long term effects of the extended disruption of education need to be assessed.

Pacific: Drought - 2023-2024,"**Federated States of Micronesia:** The drying trend intensifies through October and November, reaching its peak in January of the year following an El Niño event. During this period, rainfall in the western Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) can be as much as 50-60 per cent below the average from January through April. Based on these predictions, it is anticipated that FSM will face severe drought conditions in the first quarter of 2024, especially El Niño is officially declared by the end of September 2023 [...] The Micronesia Red Cross Society (MRCS) is currently gathering data to assess the impact of this slow-onset disaster. However, the urgency to mobilize resources and stocks to meet future needs is evident. The trigger for requesting a Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) is the potential severity of the situation, including escalated drought and cyclone risks, the islands' vulnerability, and logistical challenges. Therefore, prompt readiness actions are crucial, focusing on resource mobilization and strategic planning to alleviate expected hardships. Once the country officially acknowledges the drought situation, upgrading the imminent IFRC-DREF to a full-response IFRC-DREF will be imperative to safeguard communities and ensure sustainability in these challenging times. Once MRCS receives more data to confirm the impact of this slow-onset disaster, it will start to mobilise resources and stocks to cater for future emerging needs. To fully respond to the effects of this drought, this will be confirmed once the effects are visible, and the country is declared in a drought situation where this imminent IFRC-DREF will then be upgraded to a full response IFRC-DREF.

As a result of the El Niño phenomenon, **Micronesia** is currently experiencing a period of drought, characterized by persistently elevated temperatures. The consequential impact of this climatic condition is becoming increasingly evident within the local community and schools. Recognizing the severity of the situation, the State Government of Pohnpei issued an emergency declaration regarding water scarcity on 12 January 2024. The drought has significantly disrupted daily life in Pohnpei, leading to adjustments such as schools adopting half-day schedules. Furthermore, the local restaurants or establishments have been compelled to limit their services to takeaways only, underscoring the acute shortage of water resources. The community's response to this crisis is noticeable, with individuals taking proactive measures to mitigate potential water shortages by accumulating water in containers and jars. The multifaceted consequences of the drought are posing challenges that extend beyond mere inconveniences, prompting a collective effort to adapt to and cope with the adverse effects of the ongoing water scarcity. ([IFRC, 19 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4032388))

On 11 March, the President of FSM (Federated States of **Micronesia**) declared a State of Emergency in response to severe drought conditions across the country. The most affected states are Yap, Kosrae Pohnpei and Chuuk. It is estimated that more than 6,000 people have been affected. The absence of rainfall is leading to the depletion of rain catchment and river systems throughout the country. This particularly affects residents in the Outer Islands who rely on these systems, posing a significant threat to sanitation and public health. The projected decrease in rainfall levels across FSM indicates a worrisome trend. According to UNICEF, an estimated 16,000 individuals, with children comprising 40 percent of this population, are facing severe food insecurity. Numerous families are grappling with the challenge of ensuring sufficient nutrition for their children due to the impact of the drought on agriculture. Reports indicate substantial damage to taro patches, exacerbating the situation further. ([IFRC, 19 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4047534))

The island nation of over 100,000 people has been severely affected by El Niño conditions, causing widespread drought across the country. Over 21,000 people are in urgent need of water and food assistance, especially in Lekinioch, Piherarh, and Onoun municipalities, where saltwater intrusion into the existing water system has further aggravated the situation. ([UNICEF, 9 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4053211))

The Department of Environment, Climate Change, and Emergency Management (DECEM) reports that the drought has impacted approximately 22,700 people – about 20 per cent of the Federated States of Micronesia’s (FSM) population. ([UNICEF, 3 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4059536))

**Marshall Islands:** The islands and atolls [listed](https://reliefweb.int/node/4041493) have not experienced rainfall **since November 2023.** Within the atolls, the conditions of individual islands and islets vary. Some islands have not received any rain for the past 3 to 6 months. The latest Drought Monitor [from] January 23, 2024 lists two islands/atolls with drought conditions: Wotje and Majuro, both D1 (Moderate Drought). Beginning on 26 February, 2024, a dry pattern is returning to the Marshalls, with models indicating 10-day rainfall totals of 1 to 1.8 inches of rain across the region south of 10N, with less than 1 inch for islands/atolls from Wotje northward. [...] Previously, there has been a decline in rainfall. The island communities reliant on rainwater for their daily water needs can no longer depend on this source. These communities typically resort to accessing the underground thin layer of fresh water, located just a few inches beneath the surface, by digging small pits. However, due to rising temperatures and increased usage, this freshwater resource gradually becomes saline. In the case of islands affected by recent inundation (Winter Storm Swell), the freshwater lens has already been compromised, resulting in highly saline underground water. Evidence suggests that within a week of inundation, the leaves of some lush green trees begin to wilt. ([IFRC, 26 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4041493))

The latest updates from the US Drought Monitoring Report dated 27 February 2024 indicate a deteriorating drought situation in the **Marshall Islands** since January 2024. Specifically, the drought category for Kwajalein Atoll and Wotje Atoll has escalated from abnormally dry to Severe Drought, with Majuro and Jaluit included in the abnormally dry category. ([IFRC, 11 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4045334))

In the **Marshall Islands**, severe drought conditions are reportedly affecting over 5,200 people (12.3% of the total population) in its 15 atolls/islands. The country has experienced little or no rain in the past two to three months. Meanwhile, storm surges have caused flooding and inundation, especially in the northern islands, leading to school closures. ([UNICEF, 20 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4047949))

In the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), drought and related inundation events have affected about 14,624 people, roughly 35 per cent of the population, across 23 atolls and islands. ([UNICEF, 3 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4059536))

Brazil: Floods - Sep 2023,"Intense weather is causing casualties and damage across southern Brazil. Since 4 September, an extratropical cyclone, bringing heavy rainfall, strong winds and hailstorms, has been severely affecting the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. According to the latest assessment from the Civil Defence in Rio Grande do Sul, the severe weather has affected at least 340,928 people across 93 municipalities, leaving 46 people dead, 46 people missing and 924 injured. Some 3,130 people have been rescued, while 20,498 residents have been displaced and a further 4,794 have been left homeless. In certain areas, river levels have surged to 17 metres above average, obstructing access from the capital city of Porto Alegre and the state's northern regions. This has complicated both the delivery of aid and the assessment of damages. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, millions have been exposed to the impact of the cyclone and thousands directly impacted with damages to their homes. Entire communities are isolated and people have been waiting to be rescued. Both states are currently responding with their own resources and capacities. While the volumes of rain that have occurred in the first days of September have already exceeded the historical average in most parts of Rio Grande do Sul, the state’s Civil Defence and Secretariat of the Environment and Infrastructure (SEMA) have warned of continued severe weather from Monday 11 September through Friday 15 September. Meteorologists explain that the conditions of El Niño are influencing normal meteorological systems, bringing cold fronts, low pressure and extratropical cyclones that lead to greater frequency and intensity of rainfall.

Indonesia: Drought - 2023-2024,"The El Niño phenomenon has contributed to a prolonged dry season, resulting in crop failure and drought in the Agandugume and Lambewi sub-districts in Puncak District, Central Papua Province. An Emergency Response Status for drought events in the affected sub-districts was declared by the Regent of Puncak District, effective from 7 June to 7 August 2023. According to Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD District Puncak – Central Papua), some 7,500 people (1,800 families) are reportedly experiencing hunger as of 29 July. Essential aid, including food items, non-food items and emergency shelter kits have been distributed by the BPBD Puncak district authorities with support from the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) estimates that this dry season will persist until September 2023. ([OCHA, 2 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3985392))

According to BMKG, climate phenomena recorded in Pacific Ocean waters in May and June of 2023 triggered El Niño starting June, which further causing the region to feel warmer. Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures have been growing, with the index reaching 0.8, concerningly close to the threshold of 1, at which point the El Niño status goes from “Weak” to “Moderate”. Currently, trends show a consistent increase and by the end of August El Niño status kept on escalating. BMKG forecasted peak of drought season happens starting August and will last until September. Depending on the area affected, Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures may prolong drought to some extent. Therefore, several areas have already impacted by the drought causing water scarcity since June or beginning of August while on the other hand rain still occurs on several area. While the drought peak is not reaching the peak yet, due to the anomalies, some area may experience drought up until October or November. Moreover, BMKG forecasts indicated a high probability that several Indonesian provinces will see rainfall intensity of around 0-20mm below normal during August and September 2023. BMKG has circulated an early warning of potential drought causing water scarcity, particularly in Java and Bali, and the southern part of Sumatra. While on the field, several areas especially in East Java, Banten and Central Java provinces, already declared drought emergency alert even before the BMKG early warning circulated and water scarcity already reported in the area. On the other hand, drought season has impacted crop production in West Papua and affecting food security in the area. 

Based on PMI situation reports and other resources such as social media, news and articles, water scarcity has been broadly reported. [...] Based on secondary data review and situation at the field, there are approximately 1.2 million people affected by the drought. The number would escalate as drought will last up until September to October according to BKMG forecast. ([IFRC, 7 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3995225))

Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported 1,185 disasters between July and September 2023, of which majority are drought related. This number is significantly higher compared to the same period in 2022. [...] According to the National Food Agency (NFA), more than half of all provinces in Indonesia were considered food secure by September 2023. Out of 34 provinces, 22 provinces were categorized as stable. 12 provinces were being monitored for possible deterioration for its food security and nutrition situation, compared to 3 last year. The National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) predicted that the ongoing El Niño conditions and its resulting climate conditions over Indonesia is likely to have implications on rice planting and production, even with the regular start of rainy season in November 2023. Additionally, delayed onset of the rainy season could potentially result in reduced rice production by late 2023 and early 2024. ([WFP, 19 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4024320))

According to BMKG, starting in March 2024, the El Niño index will continue to weaken towards a neutral level until the end of the year. Based on the modeling, more and more areas, especially the northern part of Indonesia, will start to experience rainfall or even heavy rainfall. As the phenomenon continues, rainfall, in theory, cannot be the sole indicator of the end of El Niño. Thus, further forecasts will be published based on monthly weather and climate monitoring throughout Indonesia.

Slovenia: Floods - Aug 2023,"On 3-4 August, severe weather with heavy rain affected western, northern, eastern and central parts of the country, causing severe flooding and landslides. Some areas were inaccessible and necessary evacuations of residents took place. Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO) has issued a red weather alert and the national emergency response plan for floods has been activated. The national authorities confirmed one person died. On 5 August, severe weather conditions continued to affect the country. Heaviest precipitation was reported mainly in the foothills of the Julian Alps and along the line of the Zidanško–Idrija region, through Gorenjska towards Koroška and the Upper Savinjska region. The Savinja Valley, Gorenjska and Koroška regions were severely affected, as a bridge on the main transport road was swept away and many state roads remain closed due to the flooding. During the day and overnight the precipitation moved to the south-east of Slovenia towards Kočevje, Kolpa and Bela Krajina region, where highest risk levels were declared. On 6 August severe weather conditions persisted in Slovenia with rivers still overflowing across the country. The Sava River flooded heavily. Drava River was stabilised in the upper reaches and was moderated in the lower reaches. Mura river in Gornja Radgona was stabilised. It was reported that embankment on Mura river near settlement Krapje Verzej was breached. The Krka river overflowed in some areas. Problematic areas concerned the Sava and Krka rivers confluence around Krška Vas. The water level of Drava river slowly receded. Its flow, including from the Austrian side, was under control. A similar pattern was also observed for Mura river. On 7 August, the situation in Slovenia has slightly improved, however the situation remained critical since some rivers were still overflowing across the country. The heavy rainfall caused widespread damage leading to the collapse of at least seven main and regional bridges and mainly impacted roads and the energy infrastructure. Many more local bridges were damaged. On 8 August access to remote areas and areas affected by landslides still remained difficult. Approximately two-thirds of Slovenia's territory is currently grappling with the aftermath of flash floods, torrential rain, and hailstorm, with 181 municipalities affected out of the total of 212. In total, 8,000 people have been evacuated to their relatives or other accommodation facilities, and six people have lost their lives as a consequence of the disaster. Heavily affected regions include Upper Carniola, Central Slovenia, Koroška region, as well as Savinjska region. [...] In the most affected areas, communication is disrupted and there is severe damage to infrastructure. Over 170 landslides are active, posing a continued threat to homes, infrastructure, and electricity. [...] On 11 August, the Ministry of Defense reported that by their first estimates more than 400 buildings (some including multiple housing units) were completely destroyed or declared uninhabitable. The loss of assets, homes and businesses, livestock, crops and infrastructure will affect job security and livelihoods in the mid-to long term. Because of the continuous threat of landslides, it is expected that more households will become in need of long-term shelter and basic needs support during the upcoming months.

Up to epidemiological week 29 (16 - 22 July), SESAL has reported at least 9,278 cases of dengue of which 63 are cases of severe dengue. The cases have increased since week 16 and the epidemic is expected to intensify over the next few weeks unless emergency actions are taken, mainly in urban areas with environmental and demographic conditions conducive to the proliferation of the vector due to seasonal rains and the lack of proper water storage for domestic consumption. The highest accumulated cases by Epidemiological week 29 are Central District (Francisco Morazan) with 3,522 cases (13 severe) and Comayagua with 922 cases (5 severe). The epidemic situation is exacerbated due to limited capacities to respond in regions such as Comayagua where health authorities have requested support from the National Society; in other regions such as Cortes and Francisco Morazan there is an underreporting of cases due to political strife at health units (take over of facilities by unions) since several months ago which have halted the register of cases and community actions.

[...] Currently, approximately 1,000 households are still in cyclone shelters with limited access to cooking and sanitation facilities. ([Start Network, 18 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3963767))

**Myanmar:** One week after Cyclone Mocha, a clearer picture is emerging of the depth of destruction as humanitarians work to expand assistance across affected areas. Sittwe and Rathedaung are the hardest hit areas in **Rakhine.** Shelter damage there is significant across all communities. Destruction of public infrastructure, as well as disruptions to water systems, continue to limit access to clean drinking water in Rakhine, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases especially among the affected population. [...] The cyclone has led to an increase in the number of unaccompanied children in Rakhine, highlighting the urgent need for child protection and appropriate support services. ([OCHA, 21 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3963773))

A rapid analysis of contamination and incident data from Cyclone Mocha’s worst-hit areas in **Myanmar** has found that 60 per cent of the landmine incidents reported in the first quarter of 2023 were in areas that have now been affected by the cyclone. Of these, 90 per cent are reported from the highest impact area (red zone), where winds exceeding 120kmph were recorded. Nearly half of the villages that have reported contamination with high confidence (evidence of landmines reported) are located within this red zone. Moreover, nearly half of the villages that have reported contamination with lower confidence (suspicion of landmine contamination) are also in the red zone. ([OCHA, 23 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3964354))

An estimated 7.9 million people experienced winds in excess of 90km/h, with 3.4 million facing destructive winds over 120 km/h. The strength of shelters and pre-existing vulnerabilities are emerging as the key determining factors in the severity of impact and needs. In **Rakhine**, barely a home has escaped damage in the state capital Sittwe and in Rathedaung where the impact of the cyclone was strongest. An estimated 85 per cent of the shelters in IDP camps and sites are thought to have been destroyed. Many of those most severely affected are now living in temporary sites, in monasteries or in the open. A massive debris clearance and rebuilding effort has been underway across the impact zone since the cyclone with local authorities working to gradually reconnect telecommunications and electricity services particularly in the state capital Sittwe. Schools have been heavily affected, and efforts are underway to have learning facilities available for the start of the school term in June. Health facilities have also been badly damaged. In the Northwest, severe flooding affected more than 120,000 people across **Chin, Sagaing, and Magway,** with an estimated 150 villages and wards across 20 townships impacted. Infrastructure has been damaged and destroyed while floods have washed away animals, crops and personal belongings. Over 300 community learning centers were partially or totally damaged, with roofs ripped off and walls broken. ([OCHA, 25 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3965964))

A $333m Flash Appeal has been launched to support 1.6 million people in Rakhine, the Northwest, and parts of Kachin. While approval is still pending for the widescale transport of supplies and distributions, humanitarian partners have been providing shelter, water, sanitation, health and emergency food support wherever they have existing stocks and access. In Rakhine alone, the World Food Programme has reached more than 107,000 people with food support. Additionally, 7,700 households have received shelter materials and other essential relief items, while more than 30,000 liters of drinking water have been distributed. In the Northwest, affected people have been provided with cash assistance for shelter repairs, and more than 4,500 people have received hygiene kits, among other responses. ([OCHA, 29 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3966413)) [...] Approximately 80 per cent of schools and educational infrastructure reportedly sustained damage ahead of the start of the new school term. ([OCHA, 31 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3966643))

The monsoon season has arrived in Myanmar, further worsening the living situation facing people whose homes were damaged or destroyed by Cyclone Mocha. Heavy rains and some flooding were observed in areas that were already heavily impacted, further hampering the recovery process for people whose coping capacities are already stretched to the limit. Against this backdrop, access restrictions have escalated. Existing TAs that had been facilitating assistance delivery in Rakhine have been suspended pending centralized discussions in Nay Pyi Taw through the Disaster Management Committee. Using these existing approvals, humanitarians had been reaching a growing number of people in need. More than 113,200 people in the affected areas have received shelter and other relief items, while food assistance has reached more than 293,800 people in **Rakhine** alone. [...] Humanitarians had been hoping to scale-up their operations in the coming weeks, but this centralized decision on TAs now puts that on hold. Initial approval for humanitarian distribution and transport plans across 11 townships have also been rescinded pending additional deliberations in Nay Pyi Taw. Similar plans for Chin are also not yet approved. ([OCHA, 8 Jun 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3969660))

One month after Cyclone Mocha hit Myanmar’s coastal area on 14 May, the de facto authorities have suspended humanitarian access in **Rakhine,** stopping life-saving aid distributions to affected communities. Humanitarians have reached almost 300,000 people with food in Rakhine alone and more than 110,000 people with shelter support and relief items. Additionally, nearly 12,500 affected people in Rakhine state, the Northwest region and **Kachin** state received healthcare services. However, needs are enormous especially with the monsoon season well underway with many people left homeless by the cyclone and water systems severely damaged. [...] Generous funding is also vital with only US$10.3m received against a US$333 million Flash Appeal that aims to reach 1.6 million cyclone-affected people in the affected areas. ([OCHA, 12 Jun 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3971485/))

The approval of the distribution and transportation plans for the Cyclone Mocha response in **Rakhine and Chin** remains pending. Significant conditions, imposed by the State Administration Council, remain in place for the replenishment of relief supplies from outside the country and some have not yet been approved. [...] Meanwhile, efforts are underway to engage with the de facto authorities at the Nay Pyi Taw and regional level to try and expand access to people in need. This included high-level engagement with Union ministers by the RC/HC ai and UN agencies in Sittwe. Despite the humanitarian access restrictions, aid organizations have been delivering vital assistance to cyclone-affected communities where they have authorizations and supplies. More than 144,000 affected people have received shelter and other essential relief items in Rakhine and other areas since the cyclone. However, only a fraction of damaged and destroyed shelters have reportedly been repaired, leaving thousands of people without a proper roof over their heads during the monsoon season and exposing them to overcrowding and lack of privacy in the few shelters that remain functional. ([OCHA, 19 Jun 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3972441/))

As schools reopen amid the devastation caused by Cyclone Mocha, more than 300,000 learners require educational support, and an estimated 1,246 schools are heavily damaged across Rakhine and the Northwest. [...] Travel authorization issues pose challenges to the operations of Cluster partners, severely delaying the delivery of response activities. In Kyauktaw township, the need for partners to actively provide education services during emergencies hampers education delivery in critical situations. Cyclone-affected areas across the country are struggling with debris that has yet to be cleared, slowing down the repair and reopening of schools. The persistent aerial attacks on schools have exacerbated the humanitarian situation for learners. These attacks not only endanger the lives and well-being of students but also threatens the stability of the education system. ([UNICEF, 3 Jul 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3976693/))

In **Rakhine**, three months following Cyclone Mocha, decision making for the cyclone response continued to be centralized in Nay Pyi Taw which has significantly delayed disaster response. [...] Shelter assistance remains a primary concern with more than 72,000 Rohingya and Kaman IDPs in camps being in need of shelter reconstruction, 10,000 Rohingya and Kaman IDPs living in makeshift shelters being in need of shelter assistance, and more than 55,000 Rakhine IDPs being in need of shelter assistance. ([OCHA, 8 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3995416/))

As of 17 November 2023, Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) has reached 290,003 people from 58,000 households in relief assistance, including, shelter, livelihood, health and hygiene items, and multi-purpose cash assistance. [...]  The situation in Rakhine took a downturn in early November 2023, marked by clashes between armed forces in the state. [...] Since 13 November 2023, humanitarian access has been mostly limited. [...] The supply chain in the country is fluctuating due to price hikes and goods availability in the market for local procurement. This situation creates uncertainty in providing essential household item assistance to targeted communities. ([OCHA, 26 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4026124/))

Vanuatu: Earthquake - Mar 2023,"Vanuatu has been affected by two destructive cyclones and a 6.6 M earthquake between 1-4 March 2023. On 7 March, Vanuatu requested assistance from the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) for aerial capacities and vessels in support of possible evacuation, further assessment, and delivery of assistance to the people affected. ([ECHO, 8 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3941258))

Vanuatu declared a state of emergency for the whole country. The UN, NDMO and the humanitarian community are carrying out a needs assessment. Early indications indicate widespread damage and destruction to shelter, structures made from local materials (including latrines, bush kitchens, and houses), infrastructures in general, loss of crops and home gardens, and lastly water and sanitation-related needs. Port Vila and Tanna Island are the most affected areas. ([ECHO, 10 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3942192))

The disasters have caused widespread damage and destruction. The cost of damages is estimated at US$50 million. About 30,000 households are affected, and 5,000 people are still displaced in evacuation centres. Fifteen days after the disasters, food security, lack of drinkable water, and water-borne disease risks are a growing common concern among stakeholders.

Bangladesh: Cox’s Bazar Camp Settlement Fire - Mar 2023,"In the afternoon of 5 March 2023, a massive and devastating fire broke out in Kutupalong Balukhali refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Flames blazed for some three hours in Camp 11, which is managed by IOM, until the Rohingya refugee Safety Unit Volunteers trained on firefighting, local fire fighters and local authorities managed to contain the fire, around 5pm. Three-wheeler Mobile Fire Fighting Units provided by UNHCR, were deployed from across the camps and helped reach the congested areas. So far, no casualties have been reported. Some 12,000 refugees were displaced, more than 2,000 shelters were destroyed or damaged, and more than 90 facilities were damaged including hospitals and learning centres. [(UNHCR, 5 Mar 2023)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3940215/)

Although the cause of the fire incident remains unknown as no official reports have been released by the government, however, the current season, wind intensity and direction as well as the type of materials used for the settlement and density of shelters, have been key contributing factors as to why the fire had spread rapidly and engulfed its surrounding areas. Based on situation reports dated 6 March 2023, more than 3,000 households or more than 15,000 individuals have been affected, with more than 5,000 individuals displaced. More than 2,800 shelters have been damaged (2,664 fully damaged; 141 partially damaged) including their household belongings such as blankets, sleeping mats, clothing, cooking materials, mosquito nets and hygiene related items. More than 1,000 WASH infrastructures were destroyed including three water networks, four Fecal Sludge Managment (FSM) Treatment plants, one Material Recovery Facility (MRF), 153 bathing cubicles, 538 latrine doors, and 351 tube-wells with hand pumps. Moreover, three Health facilities were destroyed, including one Health Post (HP)and two Primary Health Centers (PHCs). In addition, 155 critical infrastructures such as learning centers, Women Friendly Spaces, women-led community center, child friendly space, moktubs/mosques, have been reported to be destroyed including their equipment and materials being used.

Equatorial Guinea: Marburg Virus Disease Outbreak - Jan 2023,"From January 7th to February 6th, 2023 the Ministry of Health of Equatorial Guinea identified a cluster of deaths in two remote districts of the continental region of Equatorial Guinea (Nosrk Nsomo and Ebebiyim) where a total of 9 deaths occurred with similar symptoms related to viral hemorrhagic fever. Equatorial Guinea currently does not have the laboratory capacity to test for VHF, hence samples from those who were sick and from close contacts were sent to Gabon and Senegal. The samples sent for testing in Gabon were negative, but the out of the eight samples sent to Dakar, Senegal, one tested positive for the Marburg virus. On 13 February 2023, the Equatorial Guinea MoH officially [declared the outbreak](https://www.afro.who.int/countries/equatorial-guinea/news/equatorial-guinea-confirms-first-ever-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak). As of 17 February, 1 case is confirmed, 8 are probable (deaths from individuals with VHF symptoms that were not tested), and 16 suspect cases in isolation (2 are showing signs and symptoms). 21 additional are considered secondary contacts. There is restricted access to Kie Ntem district, with an estimated 4,235 people in quarantine. The affected district is located in the north-east of Equatorial Guinea mainland, bordering Cameroon and Gabon. Several suspected cases were identified in Cameroon, but all samples were negative for the Marburg virus. There is no notification of cases or symptoms related to Marburg on the Gabonese territory. ([IFRC, 1 March 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3938950))

Equatorial Guinea's Ministry of Health has confirmed eight more cases of Marburg, bringing the number of confirmed cases to nine since the outbreak of the viral haemorrhagic fever was declared on 13 February. The new cases were confirmed following laboratory analysis of additional samples. So far, there are 20 probable cases and 20 deaths. The new cases have been reported from Kie Ntem in the east, Litoral in the country's west, and Centro Sur provinces, all with international borders with Cameroon and Gabon. The areas reporting cases are about 150 kilometres apart, suggesting wider transmission of the virus. ([WHO, 23 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3946146))

According to the first estimate, 100% of the population have been affected with wind below 80 km/h and about 50% with wind between 80 to 200 km/h. The main affected provinces are Shefa and Tafea. The damages are severe to extreme, and a second potential Category 3 cyclone is expected in the next 1 to 2 days. Up to 50,000 children may be affected. UNICEF Vanuatu Field Office also predicts that some schools will be affected, although all remain closed for the time being. Staff are ready to be deployed where necessary, emergency pre-positioned supplies are ready to be delivered to assist over 20,000 people. ([UNICEF, 2 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3939267/))

On the morning of 2 March (local time) the centre of tropical cyclone JUDY was about 245km south-east of Tanna and 150km south-east of Aneityum. JUDY's destructive winds uprooted trees and some people were evacuated. Damage assessments are ongoing in Port Vila and Vanuatu's northern islands while another storm is forecast to be on its way. Media reports, as of 2 March, around 500 evacuated people in some evacuation centres across the Capital City Port Vila and a number of damaged buildings, closed schools and several power outages across the country. There are no reports of deaths or serious injuries in Port Vila caused by cyclone JUDY, however, the islands of Erramango and Tanna were expected to be hit hard. Heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and floods were still expected over the northern islands. Some NGOs are coordinating with the government and prepositioning Non Food Items for shelter and cooking materials. In addition, tropical depression 09F (cyclone KEVIN) is forming in the Pacific. The storm is expected to move south-east bringing gale force winds to Vanuatu on 2 March and later to New Caledonia. The Fiji Meteorological Service issued a gale warning.

An initial assessment of the damage informed by the Vanuatu Disaster Management Office (NDMO) revealed many houses on Epi Island in Shefa Province were destroyed, with some families sheltering under beds and tables in their houses, while passed. There has been extensive damage to houses, churches, crops, and power lines, as well as flooding in low-lying areas. There is currently no confirmed figure as to the extent of damage, though it is estimated that more than 50 per cent of houses are damaged in rural Efate Island while in urban Port-Vila, at least 20 per cent of houses are damaged. Major damage is likely in Shefa –especially Port Vila, and Tafea provinces, especially Tanna Island. At least 64 per cent of the country's population is directly affected by TC Judy Category 3 and TC Kevin Category 4. In Port Vila, five evacuation centres were established and as of 5 March 2023, were occupied by more than 500 people. More people have attended centres since the cyclones passed than sheltered in place during the eventindicating the level of significant shelter damage in the wake of the cyclones. It is still unclear as to the extent of the damage for different sectors. Some initial observations have reported contamination of water sources due to flooding, as well as significant foliage and crop damage due to flooding and strong wind, especially in central Tanna. No fatalities have been reported to date, however, reports of injuries from flying debris and continuing to come in from across the country.

Lebanon: Cold Wave - Jan 2023,"In February 2023, Lebanon has been hit by a wave of severe winter weather, leading to a drop in temperature with snow at high altitudes and rain at lower altitudes, thunderstorms, and strong winds. Winter storm Farah hit Lebanon on 31 January 2023 and was followed by a cold spell and heavy precipitation. On 6 February, the weather deteriorated in the North of the country and the Ministry of Education announced the closure of public and private schools nationwide for a period of three days. Data from Interagency Coordination Lebanon indicate that people were impacted in the Bekaa Valley, Beirut and surrounding population centers in Mount Lebanon, and the South and North regions of the country (Interagency Coordination Lebanon 7 February). In Lebanon’s northernmost governorate of Akkar, 1-2 meters of snow were reported at high altitudes (National News Agency 9 February). Many roads were closed for a week or longer due to limited ability of municipalities to clear snow and ice. As of 14 February, many roads still above 1500 meters remained impassable due to snow accumulation (National News Agency 14 February). At lower altitudes in the same governorate, heavy rains led to flooding of waterways including the Kebir River which forms part of the border with Syria. In the Bekaa Valley, which stretches between two mountain ranges, heavy rains were reported at low altitudes. Flooding occurred at multiple sites, with an additional risk of flooding identified due to rising levels of the Litani River. In the northern Bekaa Valley in Baalbek-Hermel governorate, three Syrian children drowned when a waterway overflowed. The area was also affected by the closure of cross-mountain roads connecting the region to the rest of the country due to snow and ice accumulation (Al Jazeera 7 February).

The flooding and windstorms have destroyed or damaged more than 3,000 tents, many of which were set up to house people displaced due to the earthquakes. The flood damage has also caused some displaced families to lose their food stocks, while rendering some latrines unusable and led to the collapse and clogging of some septic tanks.

Namibia: Floods - Jan 2023,"Heavy rains were received in southeastern parts of Angola and northeastern parts of Namibia in the Cuvelai catchment during the 2nd week of January 2023, resulting in flooding conditions in Ondjiva and surrounding areas. First floodwaters were observed in some of the eastern flowing Cuvelai Iishanas (river plains) in the morning of Friday the 13 January 2023 and during the early hours of the 17th of January, the hydrological recording station at Shanalumono located approximately 10km southwest of Oshikango reported floodwaters reaching the central Cuvelai Iishanas (river plain) with local media reporting dozens of homes flooded in several villages including Engela and Ouhongo. Shanalumono is one of the main Iishanas (river plains) of the central Cuvelai River System on the Namibian side. According to the Namibia Hydrological Services, the water levels in the main Iishanas (river plains) south of the Angola/Namibia border are rising. On 27 January 2023, water levels at Engela station exceeded the 1m mark. Flood levels continue to increase as more rain persists in the Cuvelai catchment. The government with the support of Namibia RC has started some assistance to the affected people but given the increasing numbers of people affected and the limited support available for the affected households, on the 6 and the 7 of February 2023, the Oshana and Ohangwena regional councils issued formal requests to the NRCS to support the affected households.

Tropical Cyclone Freddy - Feb 2023,"Intense Tropical Cyclone FREDDY, a particularly powerful and compact tropical system, will likely pass just north of La Rèunion on 20 February, and is forecasted to make landfall in Madagascar on 21 February. FREDDY represents a significant flood risk for Madagascar as soils are already saturated in central parts of the island from the impact of Cyclone Cheneso, which stalled off the west coast of the island and brought torrential rains in late January that affected over 90,000 people with 33 people killed and 20 people still missing. Currently, about 34,000 people are still homeless. At the same time, over 89,090 people have been affected by extreme weather events in Mozambique since the beginning of the rainy season. Over 15,00 people are currently displaced due to the floods in Southern Mozambique alone. ([ECHO, 17 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3934794))    

Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy is moving west-south-west and is expected to make landfall on the eastern coast of Madagascar, probably between Mahanoro and Manakara, on 21 February evening, likely at an intense stage [...] In Madagascar, the regions of Atsinanana, Vatovavy and Fitovinany are under yellow alert (threat), while Analanjirofo, Atsimo Atsinanana, Alaotra, Analamanga, Itasy, Vakinankaratra, Amoron'i mania, Matsiatra Ambony, Ihorombe, Menabe, Beroroha, Ankazoabo, Sakaraha, Morombe and Toliara regions are under a green alert (warning), according to Meteo Madagascar. Areas near the projected landfall of Cyclone Freddy are still struggling to recover from the impacts of cyclones Batsirai and Emnati in 2022, which made landfall in near Mananjary city on 5 February and in Manakara town on 23 February 2022, respectively, and destroyed homes, infrastructure and crops, with 874,000 people still facing severe food insecurity in the Grand Sud-Est [...] After crossing Madagascar, cyclone Freddy could emerge in the Mozambican Channel and strengthen again before making landfall in Mozambique and potentially moving on to impact Zimbabwe, after decreasing in strength. Over 3.3 million people in Madagascar (2.3 million), Mozambique (527,000) and Zimbabwe (531,000) could be impacted by wind speeds of 120km/hr during cyclone Freddy’s passage across the three countries [.] ([OCHA, 20 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3935561))

Tropical Cyclone Freddy made landfall on the eastern coast of Madagascar, near Mananjary, on 21 February. The weather system slightly weakened before landing, but still sustained average winds of 130 km per hour (km/h), and gusts of 180 km/h near the eye, causing a storm surge and ripping roofs off houses and critical infrastructure, including schools. At least four people in Madagascar have died and 11,000 have been displaced by the storm’s passage. More than 4,500 houses have been flooded or damaged (2,276 flooded and 2,267 damaged), mainly in Vatovavy Region, according to preliminary estimates from the National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC). Ahead of Cyclone Freddy’s arrival, BNGRC pre-emptively evacuated 7,000 people in the coastal region who were in the storm’s path, while schools and public transportation were suspended. Cyclone Freddy followed a similar path to Cyclones Batsirai and Emnati, which made landfall near Mananjary city on 5 February and in Manakara town on 23 February 2022, respectively, affecting over 423,800 people. Since its landfall, the weakened tropical weather system has continued its trajectory inland across Madagascar, according to Meteo France. Freddy is expected to emerge in the Mozambique Channel in the evening of 22 February and will begin to gradually intensify again before landing on the coast of Mozambique on 24 February, likely between Inhambane and Beira. Freddy is expected to impact Mozambique at the stage of a strong tropical storm, bringing potentially destructive winds and heavy rains of between 100 mm/24h and 200/mm. After landfall, the system is expected to weaken as it moves inland, but could still bring significant amounts of rain that can generate flooding in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, according to Meteo France. While Cyclone Freddy is not expected to impact Malawi, authorities have warned that wet weather should be expected over most areas of the country due to an Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which will oscillate in the next couple of days. ([OCHA, 22 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3936482))

Tropical Cyclone Freddy made its second landfall in **Mozambique** in Quelimane District, Zambezia Province, on 11 March. The Freddy weather system has continued to move over land as a tropical depression, with a localized centre close to the border between Mozambique and the southern tip of **Malawi**, according to Meteo France. Although the system has weakened considerably, it is still generating intense rainfall in the interior of Mozambique and southern Malawi, with extreme rainfall forecasted for the days ahead across Zambezia, Sofala and Tete provinces in Mozambique and southern Malawi, according to the latest Flood Risk Bulletin produced for and with support of the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom. In **Mozambique**, Freddy has brought strong winds to Zambezia province, as well as heavy rains (above 200mm/24h) to Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, Tete and Niassa provinces. Some of these provinces received as much rain in 24 hours as they would usually experience in one month. In Zambezia province alone, over 22,000 people have sought refuge in temporary accommodation centres, 10 people have died and 14 have been injured. About 1,900 houses have been damaged (1,050) or destroyed (832), according to preliminary data from the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD), and these figures are expected to rise ahead as further information becomes available. Basic services and public infrastructure have also been affected. In **Malawi**, the President has declared a State of Disaster in the Southern Region, particularly Blantyre City and District, Chikwawa District, Chiradzulu District, Mulanje District, Mwanza District, Neno District, Nsanje District, Phalombe District, Thyolo District, and Zomba City and District. At least 111 people have lost their lives, and at least 16 are reportedly missing following heavy rains and strong winds attributed to the Freddy weather system since 12 March, according to Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA). Eighty-five of those killed died due to mudslides in Cilobwe township in Blantyre district. Some 19,000 people (4,000 households) have been displaced in the hardest-hit districts (Nsanje (approximately 5,850 people), Chikwawa (5,004), Mulanje (3,659), Thyolo (2,390) Blantyre City and District (1,647), Chiradzulu (765)), while data is not yet available for Mwanza, Neno and Phalombe. Water levels in areas surrounding the Shire River have started to rise and Thuchila River is also at risk of flooding. Rainfall accumulation over southern Malawi could reach 400mm to 500mm over the space of 72 hours. The Ministry of Education temporarily suspended classes in the 10 at-risk districts on 13 and 14 March. In **Madagascar**, at least 17 people have now died due to Tropical Cyclone Freddy (7 from the first landfall on 21 February and 10 from the latest rains on 5 and 6 March), three are missing and nearly 299,000 people have affected (226,000 in the south east, and over 72,600 in the south-west). Following Freddy’s pass-by the south-west of the country on 5 and 6 March, localized floods are visible in Morombe city and its three surrounding municipalities, as well as Toliara city, where schools and other administrative buildings are still flooded, according to the findings of an aerial assessment. However, the impact of the storm was less than expected and there is almost no visible wind damage in the villages along the western coast between Morombe and Toliara and less than 5 per cent damage has been reported in the agricultural sector following rapid removal of water on crop fields and rice fields.

Approximately 34,400 families are displaced and currently either being hosted in temporary shelters, including governmental buildings, or staying with relatives with reportedly dire humanitarian needs. There are currently 29 designated shelters and the number is expected to increase in the coming days/weeks. In Tartous, a total of 0.9 million people are directly or indirectly affected by the earthquake. There are two designated shelters; the number is expected to increase in the coming days/weeks. ([OCHA, 16 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3934568/))

As of 18 February, 40,642 people were killed and more than 108,000 were injured due to the earthquakes in Turkey, while over 430,000 people from affected areas have been relocated to other provinces, according to AFAD. [...] As of 19 February 2023, AFAD reports that 65 United Nations Classified and other International Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Teams are active on the ground. [...] The teams are working in the provinces of Malatya, Kahramanmaraş, Adiyaman, Gaziantep, and Hatay. A total of 191 international teams concluded search and rescue operations and have demobilized. ([OCHA, 19 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3935141/))

The local authorities in badly hit Aleppo [..] continue to provide immediate support to those displaced to collective shelters (it is estimated that there are still some 200 such shelters in Aleppo although the number changes daily). [...] With the search and rescue phase of the response nearly over, (humanitarian) partners are focused on assisting people in collective shelters and, in this regard, a minimum package of assistance has been developed and is being refined. [...] In Lattakia, partners met with the Government-led Operations Room, where local authorities reported that 103 buildings
had collapsed, 300 buildings are at risk of collapsing (people have been evacuated from them) and 172,000 people are displaced. Most of these are staying with host communities although the authorities have made just 29 shelters available leading to overcrowding. ([OCHA, 18 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3935078/))

At 20:04 on 20 February 2023, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Hatay in southern Türkiye which was followed by a 5.8 magnitude aftershock three minutes later and 90 subsequent aftershocks. These earthquakes were felt throughout the region, causing renewed fear for those who survived the devastating earthquakes on February 6, 2023, which killed 42,310 people in the country as of 21 February 2023 according to Türkiye’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD). After the latest earthquakes on February 20, AFAD reported that six people lost their lives, at least 294 people were injured, 18 of which severely, and ten buildings collapsed. ([OCHA, 21 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3936192/))

The UN and humanitarian partners are scaling up their cross-border operation which has served as lifeline to millions of people in north-west Syria since 2014. As of 27 February, over 420 trucks loaded with aid provided by six UN agencies have crossed from Türkiye to north-west Syria using three border-crossings: Bab Al-Hawa, Bab Al-Salam and Al Ra’ee. The UN has so far completed 17 cross-border missions to north-west Syria since the first interagency visit to Idleb on 14 February. [...] At least 3 million people affected by the earthquakes are in the Idleb province. More than 4,500 deaths and more than 8,700 injuries due to the earthquakes have been reported in north-west Syria, as of 26 February, according to the Health Cluster. The districts with the highest number of deaths and injuries as of 25 February remain Harim, followed by Afrin and Jisr-Ash-Shugur. As of 26 February, more than 1,700 buildings have been completely destroyed and more than 8,600 buildings have been partially destroyed. Some 60 per cent of partially destroyed buildings were reported in Harim in the Idleb Governorate and Afrin in the Aleppo Governorate. ([OCHA, 28 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3938340/))

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on 6 March that the death toll from the deadly earthquakes has risen to 46,104. He said the number of collapsed and heavily damaged buildings in 11 provinces in the earthquake zone reached 230 thousand. The President added that currently 3 million 320 thousand people were evacuated from the earthquake zone and went to other provinces, while 800 thousand people in the region took shelter in their villages. [...] On 2 March, Türkiye’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) reported that the total number of people who were given shelter in the region affected by the earthquake is 1,593,808. In other provinces, a total of 329,960 people affected by the disaster are provided with accommodation services, bringing the total number of people provided with shelter and accommodation to more than 1.9 million. ([OCHA, 09 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3941882/))

One month after the 6 February earthquake, the humanitarian situation in the affected areas across Syria remains dire despite a scale-up in humanitarian response. Prior to the earthquake, more than 15 million people were estimated to need humanitarian assistance across the country. An estimated 8.8 million people have now been affected by the earthquake. [...] The earthquake caused an estimated US$5.1 billion in direct physical damages in Syria, according to a World Bank report, with nearly half of the damages caused to residential buildings. 3.7 million children in earthquake-affected areas across Syria are facing potentially catastrophic threats, including contagious, contact-transmitted and waterborne diseases and lack of access to basic services. ([OCHA, 09 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3941678/))

2.3 million people [in Türkiye] have been identified as living in formal and informal settlements across earthquake affected areas as of 16 March. Out of this number, 1.6 million have been identified to be living in informal settlements. ([OCHA, 17 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3944550/))

At least 3 million people affected by the earthquakes are in the Idleb province. More than 4,500 deaths and more than 8,700 injuries due to the earthquakes have been reported in north-west Syria, as of 13 March, according to the Health Cluster. At least 148 cities and towns in north-west Syria have been affected by the earthquakes. The districts with the highest number of deaths and injuries, as of 13 March, are Harim and Afrin. Two-thirds of all injuries were reported in Harim. As of 14 March, 1,869 buildings have been completely destroyed and 8,731 buildings have been partially destroyed. Some 57 per cent of partial and fully destroyed buildings were reported in Harim and Afrin. ([OCHA, 23 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3946475/))

On 20 March, Türkiye’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) reported that the death toll from the devastating earthquakes on 6 February has increased to 50,096. There have been 107,204 injuries. IOM reports that 3 million people have been displaced by the earthquakes in Türkiye. An estimated 1.7 million people live in informal settlements, mostly in makeshift shelters or tents with extremely basic living conditions. [...] To date, UN agencies and humanitarian partners have reached close to 535 thousand people with support for improved living spaces, including tents, Relief Housing Units (RHUs) and tarpaulins. 1.4 million people received support for water, sanitation and hygiene, and about 47 thousand people received health support. Over 345 organizations are distributing hot meals to approximately 1.25 million people every day. [...] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that the earthquakes caused $6.7 billion in losses and damage to crops, livestock production, food stocks and agricultural infrastructure and assets. ([OCHA, 24 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3946530/))

Around 60 thousand Syrians in Türkiye have returned to their home country across the border since the earthquakes on 6 February, said the Turkish National Defense Minister. Urgent support is needed to prevent a slide into poverty and an increase in child labour and low-wage jobs with no financial security or stability, following the devastating earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria in February, warned the International Labour Organization (ILO) in a new assessment report. The ILO estimates a 16.0 per cent loss in working hours in the affected areas. The reduction in activity is comparable to the hours of work done by 657 thousand full-time equivalent workers. An estimated 1.6 million people live in informal settlements, with bare minimum living conditions and limited or no access to services. Despite receiving some humanitarian support, these families still need improved shelters, water and sanitation services, and basic household items. Drinking water emerges as one of the main needs due to disruptions to water networks. These disruptions not only
create challenges for accessing safe and clean water, but also pose a significant risk to food safety, agriculture, and livestock breeding. Access to essential services, disease control, and water and sanitation services continue to be among the priority needs, particularly in informal settlements. The Ministry of National Education has resumed education in all ten provinces affected by the earthquakes. However, education in the four most severely impacted provinces has gradually resumed in specific districts. ([OCHA, 30 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3948604/))

Türkiye added six more provinces to the earthquake disaster zone as they suffered damage in the 6 February earthquakes, announced the nation’s disaster agency. The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) has added settlements in the provinces of Bingöl, Kayseri, Mardin, Tunceli, Niğde, and Batman to the qualifying zone for governmental aid, as damaged buildings were identified in these areas, according to a statement issued by AFAD. On 5 April, Türkiye’s Ministry of Interior announced that they have established 345 tent cities and 305 container cities in the earthquake-affected region, adding that 2.6 million people are living in tent cities, while nearly 79 thousand people are living in container cities. Additionally, the Ministry reported that over 1.6 million people have received a support payment of 10,000 Turkish Liras ($519). AFAD says there has been a notable decline in the number of individuals hosted in other provinces, as many are now returning to their provinces in the earthquake-affected region. Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu has reported on 5 April that the death toll from the devastating earthquakes has risen to 50,339. The death toll is updated at long intervals due to the fact that identification of bodies takes time, Soylu said. ([OCHA, 6 Apr 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3950991/))

Ongoing environmental challenges continue to affect people, particularly those living in informal sites and tent cities. Heavy rain affected areas including Adıyaman, Kahramanmaraş, Malatya, Şanlıurfa and Hatay on 10 and 11 April, causing flooding in tents and other dwellings and a yellow warning was issued for heavy rainfall in 21 provinces, including those in the earthquake zone. On 11 April, three earthquakes measuring 4.3, 4.2 and 4.0 magnitude occurred in proximity to the areas affected by the February earthquakes. ([OCHA, 17 Apr 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3953700/))

More than 4,500 deaths and 10,400 injuries due to the earthquakes have been reported in north-west Syria according to the Health Cluster. 43 per cent of the injured are women and girls. 20 per cent of the injured are children aged five to 14 years old. At least 148 communities in north-west Syria have been affected by the earthquakes. The districts with the highest number of deaths and injuries are Harim and Afrin. Some 1,100 deaths (a quarter of reported deaths) were recorded in Jandairis in the Afrin District. At least 10,600 buildings have been destroyed by the earthquakes at varying degrees (1,869 buildings have been completely destroyed and 8,731 buildings have been partially destroyed). ([OCHA, 28 Apr 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3957102/))

People [in Türkiye] who were forced to relocate after the earthquakes are showing interest in returning to their areas of origin. This is partly attributed to the pace of the development of formal settlements housing people in containers (“container cities”). Some 20 per cent of people who temporarily relocated to cities outside the earthquake-affected provinces are returning, according to the Ministry of Interior. Financial constraints and the high cost of living in the hosting provinces may be possible factors for those returning. Rents rose 47 per cent in Gaziantep Province and 25 per cent in Hatay Province between February and April (the national average where data is available is 16 per cent). The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has observed an increase in returns of refugees to the affected provinces as well, for similar reasons. To meet the needs of the returning population, authorities are attempting to strengthen shelter capacity through temporary accommodation. ([OCHA, 29 Apr 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3957214/))

Humanitarian needs remain 100 days after devastating earthquakes hit southern Türkiye on 6 February, killing more than 50,000 people and creating widespread damage and destruction. More than half a million buildings sustained significant damage forcing some 3 million people to relocate. [...]

To date, partners have directly provided 4 million people with some sort of humanitarian assistance and have provided in-kind goods and services through the government to benefit an estimated 2.3 million people. However, the sheer scale of the disaster means that many people continue to have significant unmet needs.

Many of the approximately 2.6 million people (650,000 households) currently living in tents in both formal and informal sites are likely to continue doing so during the hot summer months, with basic living conditions and limited services. ([OCHA, 17 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3963175/))

At the end of May, 5.4 million people had received at least one form of humanitarian assistance in the earthquake-affected areas, up from 4 million people reached until end of April. [...] The increase in the number of people reached from previous reporting is attributable to ongoing humanitarian activities, as well as refinements in the common activity reporting system. ([OCHA, 25 June 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3976432/))

More than 4,500 deaths and 10,400 injuries due to the earthquakes have been reported in north-west Syria according to the Health Cluster. 43 per cent of the injured are women and girls. 20 per cent of the injured are children aged five to 14 years old. At least 148 communities have been affected and the districts with the highest number of deaths and injuries are Harim and Afrin. 

More than 10,600 buildings have been destroyed by the earthquakes at varying degrees including at least 1,000 primary and secondary schools. Nearly a third of the 601 health facilities are non-functional, 70 of which were damaged by the disaster.

The need for dignified shelters: the Shelter/NFI Cluster reported that the homes of at least 855,000 people were damaged to varying degrees by the earthquakes. Out of this figure, 265,000 people who lost their homes are in need of dignified shelters. The Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster reported that over 66,000 individuals are living in newly established reception centers. ([OCHA, 21 Jul 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3982307/))

As of 8 August, based on findings from the second round of Displacement Tracking Matrix/Temporary Sites and Settlements site mapping, there are 181,264 households living in temporary sites in the four most affected provinces [in Türkiye], a 59 per cent decrease compared to March 2023 round one data. For informal sites alone, 100,159 households were identified in August 2023, representing a 64 per cent reduction since March. Figures from authorities show that there are 344,016 people in 40 formal tented sites (23,211 people), and 349 container sites (320,805 people). [...] Returns have been observed by some households that departed the affected areas after the earthquake. For example, half a million people in Hatay were reported to have departed after the earthquake, with 159,087 returns recorded (28 per cent of those who departed) in June 2023. In Malatya, of the 804,896 pre-earthquake population, an estimated 300,000 departed, with 109,225 returns recorded as of June (approximately 42 per cent). In Adiyaman, only nine tent cities are left, three of which are populated by Syrian refugees. ([OCHA, 15 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3989112/))

As of 25 August, the structural assessment teams in Aleppo Governorate have assessed 126,029 buildings, including 33,058 that require reinforcement, 5,192 that require demolishment, and 87,779 that are safe. [...] In Lattakia Governorate, the structural assessments conducted by the High Safety Committee show that 9,627 buildings have been assessed, including 133 that are safe, 3,715 that require rehabilitation, 4,808 that need reinforcement, and 963 that should be demolished. [...] 

In Homs Governorate, 687 earthquake-displaced families (2,736 people) have been identified as of 3 September, including 660 families (2,614 people) hosted by local communities, and 27 families hosted in two shelters in Homs City [...] In addition, 354 families (1,318 people) returned to their places of origin in Aleppo, Hama, Lattakia, Tartous and Homs. ([OCHA, 02 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4002239/))

According to an assessment conducted by the Education Cluster, 54 per cent of schools in north-west Syria have been affected including some 1,000 partially damaged schools. At least 1 million school-aged children are now out of school – an increase from 800,000 children estimated prior to the disaster. Among key concerns are consequences that may not be immediately apparent including the mental toll on children, teachers and education workers. Following the earthquakes, over 22,000 teachers in north-west Syria are in need of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS), fair compensation, and capacity-building to address the learning loss. ([OCHA, 02 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4011386/))

Following the earthquakes, the number of food insecure people has increased from 3.3 million to 3.7 million people – or 82 per cent of the population in north-west Syria. ([OCHA, 02 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4011615/))

As of 17 September, 159 earthquake-displaced families (approximately 697 people) in various governorates have returned to Idleb Governorate. [...] In Aleppo Governorate, nine medium-term collective shelters continue to accommodate 466 earthquake-affected families (2,385 people). Dozens of other families remain on the waiting list. [...] An INGO commenced rehabilitating around 50 damaged houses for earthquake-affected families in Hama. Moreover, an INGO distributed 100 tents for the affected families, where 90 tents have been set up by end of September. Humanitarian agencies, in collaboration with the DoE, plan to rehabilitate 69 earthquake-affected schools in Hama Governorate, while the DoE lightly rehabilitated 63 ones.

As of 24 September, all the collective shelters in Hama Governorate have closed, and the evacuated families either received a tent or assistance to rent an apartment.

In Homs Governorate, 26 earthquake-affected families continue to be hosted in two collective shelters in Homs City.

In September, all collective shelters have closed in Lattakia and families will receive cash assistance of SYP7.5 million for housing rent. Currently, 38 displaced families are hosted in 33 units in Naqa’a (long-term housing), Jableh town in Lattakia Governorate. The long-term shelters in six other locations are still under construction and are expected to be ready in two months. There are no available accurate figures of IDPs still living outside the shelters. ([OCHA, 09 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4013464/))

These devastating events resulted in the interruption of education for over four million children in Syria. [...] 63 schools, with moderate and severe damage, comprising 609 classrooms for around 10,000 students, remain closed.  

As of 24 October, the Operations Room in Aleppo had commenced emptying the remaining nine collective shelters housing 466 earthquake-affected families. [...] In Lattakia Governorate, 193,488 earthquake-affected families (890,045 people) had been identified in four districts as of 29 October. Since February, the constructional/General Safety Committees have assessed 107,638 buildings where 59,371 buildings are deemed safe, 27,483 require rehabilitation, 19,013 require reinforcement and 1,771 should be demolished. Of note, all initially designated shelters in the governorate no longer house any displaced families. ([OCHA, 04 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4019795/))

Multi-purpose cash assistance in particular took prominence [in Syria] in the earthquake response given the resilience of local markets. Its flexibility enables families to buy what they need of their own choice, all while stimulating the local economy. Within a week of the earthquakes, $1.8 million of multi-purpose cash was distributed to 13,000 affected families, who were either homeless, displaced, or in need of medical care. This support has since exponentially risen. As of 15 November, some 215,000 families – nearly 1 million people – have received multi-purpose cash valued at $32 million since the start of 2023. At least half of Afrin’s population and nearly a quarter of Harim’s population were supported. ([OCHA, 21 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4025160/))

Around 159 earthquake-affected families returned from Lattakia, Aleppo and Hama Governorates to Idleb Governorate. Of those, 55 families are hosted in two shelters in Khan Shaykun City, while the rest are hosted by relatives. [...]

Rehabilitation efforts for earthquake-affected schools in Lattakia Governorate are currently underway through collaborative initiatives among the Directorate of Education, INGOs and national NGOs. To date, 71 schools have been successfully rehabilitated. The Directorate of Education supervised the rehabilitation of 60 schools, while humanitarian organizations have contributed to the rehabilitation of 11 schools. [...]

Since February, the technical engineering teams in Lattakia Governorate have assessed 107,638 buildings, including 59,371 buildings that are safe, 27,483 that require rehabilitation, 19,013 that require reinforcement, and 1,771 that should be demolished.

On 30 November, the Aleppo earthquake response Operations Room evacuated the remaining 466 earthquake-affected families who were staying in nine collective shelters. ([OCHA, 03 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4027418/))

In Aleppo Governorate, 54 buildings collapsed while an ongoing structural assessment at the governorate level has so far revealed that out of 126,029 assessed buildings, 33,058 buildings are structurally damaged and would require structural rehabilitation. 5,192 buildings cannot be rehabilitated and require demolition. All shelters in Aleppo City were evacuated and closed by 30 November 2023; eligible families received cash assistance to secure alternative accommodation.

As of 31 December, 242,625 earthquake-affected people (48,525 families) have been identified in Hama Governorate, including 6,011 displaced as their houses were badly damaged and needed to be demolished, and 42,514 families displaced as their houses were partially damaged and need rehabilitation. Most displaced families were hosted in shelters or by the local community and relatives. In February 2023, Hama Governorate opened 17 shelters for those affected, and by the end of September, the governorate closed all shelters. People who left the shelters either returned to their houses or were hosted by their relatives/rented houses.

In Homs Governorate, 1,044 earthquake-displaced families (4,069 people) have been identified as of 31 December. Out of those, 363 families (1,365 people) returned to their places of origin in Aleppo, Hama, Lattakia, Tartous and Homs. Also, 681 families (2,704 people) are hosted by local communities, and 19 families (84 people) are hosted in two shelters in Homs City.

In Lattakia, approximately 193,488 families (890,045 people) have been impacted by the earthquake in four locations (Lattakia, Jableh, Haffeh and Al-Qardaha). A total of 105 buildings were destroyed. To date, 107,638 buildings have been assessed including 27,483 that require rehabilitation, 19,013 that need reinforcement, and 1,771 that should be demolished. ([OCHA, 07 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4036189/))

The earthquakes severely exacerbated the already dire situation in Syria. Over 5,900 deaths and more than 12,800 injuries were reported in Syria, according to the Health Sector and the Ministry of Health (MoH). [...]

Overall, 170 sub-districts in 43 districts in ten governorates were impacted by the earthquakes. The most affected areas included Aleppo Governorate
where 4.2 million people were affected to varying degrees. Almost three million people in Idleb Governorate were also affected. All ten governorates were exposed to shaking levels V to VII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. Many of these areas were already in dire need following 12 years of hostilities that had resulted in structural damage to many buildings and infrastructure, and weakened access to social services. 

Overall, more than 2,260 buildings were destroyed, and more than 32,000 buildings were reportedly damaged in Syria. Idleb and Aleppo were the governorates with the highest number of destroyed structures, with more than 1,180 buildings destroyed in Idleb, and more than 342 buildings destroyed in Aleppo Governorate. [...]

According to the Syria Earthquake Recovery Needs Assessment (SERNA), the earthquakes resulted in $8.9 billion in losses and $14.8 billion in recovery needs over the next three-year period. [...]

The number of people temporarily displaced due to the earthquakes peaked at around 97,400 households, in March, with most people moving within the affected sub-districts of Jandairis, Salqin, Dana and Maaret Tamsrin. ([OCHA, 03 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4043098/))

Today, as many as 43,000 displaced individuals [in Syria] have not returned home. The majority (40,500 IDPs) reside in 70 reception centers while nearly 3,100 IDPs are in camps and informal sites. ([OCHA, 15 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4046844/))

The February 2023 earthquakes in northern Syria and Türkiye have added agony to an already catastrophic situation, resulting in almost 6,000 deaths and more than 12,800 people injured in Syria, increasing the strain on services, causing displacement, and inflicting widespread damage. ([OCHA, 17 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4055352/))

As of 10 March, around 1,196 earthquake-affected families, originally from Idleb Governorate, arrived from Lattakia, Tartous, Damascus, Aleppo and Hama Governorates in the Government of Syria areas of Idleb Governorate. Of those, 55 families are currently hosted in two shelters in Khan Shaykun City while the rest are hosted by relatives. ([OCHA, 08 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4060799/))

In 2023, 11.4 million protection interventions were provided to people in need across Syria, including 2.8 million interventions (26 per cent of the total) targeting earthquake-affected persons. [...] During the emergency phase of the earthquake response, an estimated 5.4 million people needed emergency shelter interventions like emergency tents, shelter kits/materials, items/equipment to support debris removal and structural assessment along with emergency non-food items.

Mongolia: Dzud - Dec 2022,"As stated by the National Agency for Environmental monitoring and Meterology, the extreme cold had been anticipated (issued on 22 November) starting from 28 November to 2 December. [...] The forecast was materialized during 28 November - 2 December and due to precipitation and snowstorms in the central and eastern provinces during 24-25 November 2022. As of 2 December, in Uvs and Khovd provinces, 216 livestock from 12 households have perished, 2 gers have been completely destroyed, 4 people went missing and 4 found, 2 of them are being hospitalized. 

NAMEM released the Dzud risk map on 2 December 2022, which indicates that 16 per cent of the Mongolian territory is at the highest level of risk, 43 per cent is at high level of risk of Dzud, 33 per cent is at moderate risk, 10 per cent is at low and the least level of risk. The most soums with high-level risks are located in Bayan-Ulgii, Uvs, Zavkhan, Bayankhongor, Govi-Altia, Uvurkhangai, Bayankhongor, a few soums in Dornogovi, Sukhbaatar and Dundgovi are
also identified to be a very high level of risk. According to NAMEM, Dzud index has a high correlation to livestock mortality (1940 - 2015 plot of Dzud index, drought index and livestock, NAMEM), also, the vegetation index plays a major role in the shaping of winter (Trigger update variation, 501). The high temperature and low precipitation caused severe drought in the summer, which is the reason why the livestock couldn't accumulate enough fat to overcome the winter, and the meteorology office stated anomalous low temperatures in late December. As mentioned before due to the drought and economic inflation, meat price has been significantly reduced, therefore decreasing the income of herders. Combined with the severe winter, the herder households are at risk to fail to meet the immediate basic needs. ([IFRC, 8 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3914700))    

As of 1 February [2023], approximately 70 per cent of Mongolia or a total of 22 Aimags or provinces and 310 Soums or townships, are at either high or extreme Dzud situation. This has directly affected the livelihoods of 191,000 herder households. About 87,000 of these herder households have less than 200 heads of livestock and are considered vulnerable. It is reported that about 416,560 livestock have perished as of early February. Historically, though, the peak of livestock mortality is from February to April. Mongolian herder/pastoralists are heavily reliant on grazing their animals, such as goats, sheep, cattle, horses, yaks and camels, on open rangelands all year round. The availability of sufficient forage is dependent on favorable weather conditions for livestock to have sufficient food during the summer and gain strength to make it through upcoming cold season, as well as for herders to stock hay and fodder for same season. Herders' primary livelihood depends on their livestock, and preventing fatalities is their primary concern. However, in the summer of 2022, Mongolia experienced drought which led to poor pastures and malnourished livestock. The number of livestock entering the winter season also reached an all-time high of 71 million. This means a high number of livestock must be prevented from mortality over the winter season. ([OCHA, 6 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3940703))

The winter situation has been intensified by the extreme cold wave in January, where the air temperature reached -50 Celsius in Zavkhan and Uvs province. Meanwhile, in other provinces, the air temperature was colder by 3-4 Celsius than multi-year average, and snow coverage height was 37 cm as highest in the central region and averagely 27 cm in the western region, which prevents livestock from grazing. According to NAMEM data, the percentage of Mongolia's land covered in snow has increased from 14 per cent in October 2022 to 43 per cent in February 2023. The whole country experienced high precipitation starting from early November to early December 2022, major snow storms in middle of January 2023 and more precipitation in late February 2023. In November 2022, the lowest temperature reached -47 Celsius in the night in Zavkhan, Khentii, Khuvsgul, Uvs, provinces, due to prolonged and heavy precipitation, over 70 per cent of the country was covered in high snow reaching 37 cm in central region with average of 21 cm, in western region, the average snow height was 24 cm. In January 2023, the peak of cold wave started from 15 January until the end of January. ([IFRC, 8 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3941518))

Cameroon: Floods - Aug 2022,"Since August 2022, the Far North region has been experiencing flooding in several localities in the MayoDanay, Logone et Chari and Mayo-Tsanaga divisions. These floods are the result of heavy rainfall, the overflowing of rivers and the breaching of dikes. As of 21 September 2022, over 37,000 people were affected by floods with two people killed and more than 95 people injured. More than 9,000 houses were destroyed, about a dozen health facilities and 88 schools were flooded with over 26,615 children deprived of education. More than 2,400 hectares of fields were destroyed, 3,019 livestock were lost, 190 water points and 535 latrines were submerged. Communities were forced to move to safer areas, often in very precarious conditions with difficult access to drinking water, lack of latrines, food, shelters, etc. Access to hard-to-reach areas has been severely hampered by the floods, impacting the timely delivery of nutrition, food, health and protection services. Continued rainfall and rising water levels could cause the remaining dikes along the Logone river and Lake Maga to break, resulting in flooding in several localities. Despite the spontaneous response of local authorities and of the Cameroonian Red Cross, needs remain high, and the funds limited.

Cholera, a virulent bacterial infection caused by contaminated water or food, can spread quickly in areas with limited access to basic services such as safe water, sanitation, and health care. The disease can kill within just hours due to severe acute watery diarrhoea. Recent overlapping crises have severely impacted access to health, safe clean drinking water, and sanitation services for both host and refugee populations in Lebanon. As cases are expected to continue to increase, UNICEF in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), NGO partners and led by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), has developed a joint response plan.

As of 10 October, 191 cholera cases were reported in 3 woredas of Bale zone (Harana Buluk, Berbere and Delo Mena) with 4 associated deaths (Cumulative Case Fatality Rate – CFR - of 2.09 per cent1). The use of unsafe water from contaminated water points is the most likely cause of this outbreak. Limited access to water and sanitation (WASH) services, poor hygiene practices, including open defecation and lack of water treatment options are among the factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease across these three woredas. New suspected cases are reported daily in the three affected woredas. As of the reporting date, there are 15 active cases (3 cases in Delo Mena, 10 in Berbere and 2 in Harana Buluk woredas) in the existing Cholera Treatment Center (CTC), with 71 per cent of the patients experiencing severe dehydration symptoms. Due to people’s mobility, there is a high risk that the outbreak could propagate into bordering zones of Southern and Eastern Oromia, SNNP and Somali regions.

According to EPHI, close to 459,000 people are at high risk in the four woredas, especially IDPs living in sites. The response is hindered by insufficient funding and partners’ presence. Shortage of WASH treatment chemicals, limited amount of water storage items (reservoir tanks, jerry cans, etc.), insufficient water trucking capacity and large number of non-functional water schemes represent the major gaps.

Haiti: Cholera Outbreak - Sep 2022,"After more than three years without a single cholera case, as of 2 October, Haitian authorities have confirmed two cases and identified several other suspected cases across several communes in the Ouest department, including the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area and Cité Soleil. The deadly illness has resurfaced as the country continues to be paralyzed by gang blockades that have triggered severe shortages of fuel, safe drinking water and limited access to health services across the country.

Access to clean drinking water and proper sanitation services are critical for preventing the spread of cholera, raising serious concerns about containing the spread of the infection as heightened insecurity and mobility challenges increasingly limit access to both for most Haitians. Additionally, restricted access to affected areas creates challenges for the surveillance and timely assessment of the epidemiological situation while fuel shortages could affect the shipment of biological samples from health facilities to reference laboratories, creating an extra layer of complexity for prevention and response efforts. ([OCHA, 3 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3892403/))

Beyond the Ouest Department, where the majority of cholera cases are concentrated, the Centre, Artibonite and Nippes departments have also reported suspected cases. [...] As of 16 October, the Ministry of Health (MSPP) reported 22 inhospital deaths, 66 confirmed cases, and 564 suspected cases of
cholera across the country, including 188 hospitalized cases. ([OCHA, 17 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3897694/e))

d'Épidémiologie, des Laboratoires et de la Recherche (DELR) reported 7,569 suspected cases and 712 confirmed cases of cholera across the country. Of these, 655 (92%) have been reported in the Ouest Department. Other departments that reported confirmed cases are Centre (37), Artibonite (18), and Grand’Anse (2).  [...] Critical cholera supplies such as medicines, oral rehydration solution (ORS), rapid tests, ringer lactate, cholera beds as well as human resources are critically needed to scale up response activities. ([PAHO, 10 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/cholera-outbreak-hispaniola-5-10-november-2022))

Hurricane Ian - Sep 2022,"On 24 September, Tropical Depression Nine strengthened into Tropical Storm Ian. The system moved across the Caribbean Sea generating scattered showers over northern Venezuela, northern Colombia, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao and parts of Central America. The system rapidly intensified as it moved across Cuba, becoming the fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.

In Jamaica, Ian moved south of the island, producing around three to six inches of rainfall, storm surge and swells that affected coastal communities. While the tropical storm watch for Jamaica was lifted as Ian veered away from the island, a flash flood warning across several parishes remained in effect until the morning hours of 26 September, with localized flooding in some parishes, such as Clarendon, prompting the activation of emergency shelters.

In the Cayman Islands, Ian moved south-west of the islands as a Category 1 Hurricane, prompting road and dock closures as debris generated from flooding blocked access points. Power outages and disruption to water systems were reported, however, as of 27 September, electricity and water have been close to fully restored. Ian’s rapidly changing track posed challenges for preparedness and response operations in the territory, with preliminary assessments showing relatively minor flood-related impacts, especially in low-lying coastal areas.

On 26 September at 7:00 pm EST, Ian made direct landfall in Pinar Del Río province, battering large swaths of western Cuba as a powerful Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 km/h. Six western provinces have been affected and more than 61,000 people have been evacuated from high-risk areas. As per WFP-ADAM, close to 600,000 people were exposed to wind speeds of 120 Km/h or higher. According to local and international media outlets, Pinar del Río, the westernmost province of Cuba, bore the brunt of Ian’s wrath, with significant damage reported across the province. As of 27 September, Ian has reportedly left at least two people dead and thousands without electricity. In La Habana, one of the six provinces under a hurricane alert, moderate rainfall and strong wind gusts have left several areas in the island’s capital of the same name without power.

On Friday 5 August, several neighbourhoods were flooded after heavy rains hit in the capital city of Chad, Ndjamena. According to [OCHA] the rains keep affecting various regions of the country, including the province of Logone Oriental, causing human and material damage, and loss of livelihoods to a significant part of the population. The rapid assessment conducted by Red Cross of Chad (RCC) teams between 5 and 10 August 2022 identified at least 20,657 people affected, and the number continues to rise. Material damage is estimated at 2,067 houses completely destroyed. Due to lack of real-time information, this estimate does not represent all the damage (information provisionally made available by OCHA on 5 August 2022 in the snapshot). During the week of 01 to 7 August 2022, the successive heavy rainfall in N'Djamena, combined with the low-lying position of the Gozator hospital and the lack of drainage in its vicinity caused the main basin behind it to overflow and led to an unprecedented flooding of the hospital. ([IFRC, 12 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3885744))

According to the latest report of UN OCHA, almost 623,000 people have been affected across 16 of the 23 Provinces, including the Capital N’Djamena with 44,839 affected people.

([ECHO, 16 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3887129))

In the capital, N’Djamena, a quarter of the city is flooded, and the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly as over 50,000 people were displaced in the span of just days. This figure may double in the next week, as waters of the Logone and Chari rivers from the south continue to flood the capital on their way to Lake Chad. ([OCHA, 20 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3898702))

Since September 8, heavy rains battered the south of the country, causing the Chari and Logone rivers (which meet in the capital city of N'Djamena) to overflow their banks and forcing 181 720 people (28 907 households) to flee their homes and take refuge in public spaces. The flooding is a result of heavy rainfall across the country, overflowing of rivers and/or the breaching of dikes. ([OCHA, 13 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3915936))

As of January 20, 2023, the most affected provinces are Lac with 250,091 victims, Mayo Kebbi Est with 228,708 victims, Mayo Kebi Ouest (50,022 victims), Logone Occidental (147,129 victims), Logone Oriental (10,052 victims), Tandjilé (138 831 victims), Mandoul (82,608 victims), Salamat (19,080 victims), Sila (92,600 victims), Guéra (65,047 victims), and Batha (26,466 victims).

41% of the funding required for the Joint Flood Response Plan has been received (18 million) or committed (11 million, on an initial request of 69.8 million US dollars) until the end of December 2022. This amount includes the 5 million US dollars from the government's request for funding from the World Bank.([OCHA, 20 Jan 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3926433))

More than 1.4 million people were affected by floods in Chad in 2022 and many of them remain displaced in several camps in N'Djamena and Lac provinces. As of 29 of March 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that around 300,000 people were still in dire needs of assistance in several sites in N'Djamena and Bol. The Chadian government plans to close the sites in April before the start of the rainy season. Many internally displaced persons (IDPs) will have to leave the sites without any resources.

Niger: Floods - Sep 2022,"On 31st of August 2022, based on information coming from the Niger Basin Authority (NBA), in collaboration with the Directorate General of Water Resources and the Directorate of National Meteorological services, indicates that floods will occur in the week of 5 September in Niamey. As a result, the Niger Red Cross Society is activating its Early Action Protocol (EAP) for Floods. ([IFRC, 1 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3882097))

On 2 September, feedback was received from the SATHORIO that the Niamey hydrometeorological station temporarily malfunctioned during the period from 28 August to 3 September 2022, As a result, the water threshold in the bulletin dated 29 August 2022 was incorrect, which was the bulletin used to activate the EAP. Moreover, the wrong interpretation of the meteorological data was also influenced by the heavy rainfall recorded during the same period downstream of the river. Therefore, the EAP activation was a false alarm. At this time, based on the information from National Coordination Unit (NCU), and in coordination with the National Director of Hydraulics (DHN), early actions were paused pending further clarification. 

On 8 September, a field visit was organized including representatives from the CRN, the Ministry of Humanitarian Actions and Early Warning Systems, Direction of Civil Protection, National Director of Hydraulics, the local Administrative Authority, Niger Basin Authority and IFRC. The field visit identified that in addition to the false alarm mentioned above, the protective embankment is being raised (work started in August 2022) to more than 650 cm (photo 2 and 3), along the river in the Niamey River by the Disaster Risk Management and Urban Development Project (DRMP-UD). Following the field visit, on 12 September, it was unanimously decided that the probability of flooding was very low (less than 20%), therefore, the EAP actions should stop.

The torrential rains of June 21 were the heaviest recorded since the beginning of the rainy season in the country, with nearly 200 mm of water in less than 24 hours in several neighbourhoods of Abidjan and near-urban areas. This is the equivalent of several weeks of rain that caused major flooding and landslides. Waterspouts and mud and rock flows caused loss of life and serious material damage. In the 10 localities affected, the damage recorded thanks to the rapid assessment made by the Red Cross Society of Côte d'Ivoire (RCSCI) includes the destruction of 134 houses and 11 schools, the collapse of roads, flooding of markets, contamination of wells, etc. The heavy flooding led to the breaking of water pipes, thereby further increasing the water level in the communities. Ten localities were affected, including five in the hinterland (Alépé, Azaguié, Bonoua, Dabou, and Grand-Bassam) and five in Abidjan (Abobo, Anyama, Attécoubé, Bingerville, and Port-Bouët).

Mauritania: Drought - Jun 2022,"The food crisis and hunger projection in the Sahel have become increasingly alarming over the past decade in all the countries. Like other countries in the region, Mauritania is currently facing a situation of food and nutritional insecurity caused by poor spatial and temporal distribution and an increased rainfall deficit in most areas of the country during the 2021 winter season. The country, mainly arid, is experiencing highest level of drought compared to its Sahel neighbours. This situation is considered the worst since 2012. It is aggravated by the increase in the price of basic foodstuff. All resulting from the sharp rise in acquisition costs on world markets and the disruption of supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine. There is an important increase in the price of basket food in a population with a decreasing purchasing power.

In terms of geographic areas, 34 of the 48 departments analysed are classified as being in crisis (IPC Phase 3) and the rest of the areas are in the pressure phase. Moreover, 1,400,000 people in a situation of moderate food insecurity (stressed) can easily fall into severe food insecurity during and after the lean season if rapid accompanying measures are not taken to improve their situation. The most affected regions areas are located in the regions in the south (Adrar, Assaba, Brakna, Tagant, Gorgol, Guidimakha, Hodh Chargui, Hodh Ech Chargi and Hodh El Gharbi) facing drought increase, transhumance, inflation, etc.

According to the results of the Inter-Agency food security analysis conducted in March 2022, some 878,921 people (20% of the population) will be food insecure during the lean period (June-September 2022). There are 136,254 malnourished children, including 103,514 (6%) in moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and 32,740 (1.9%) in Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), compared with 116,000 children in 2020. Malnutrition rates are approaching or exceeding the emergency thresholds set by WHO. More recently, the Hunger Hotspots from FAO-WFP early warnings and FEWSNET report published 20 June 2022 forecasted a worsening of the crisis based of the low rainfall over agropastoral regions in the south. The acceleration of the observed transhumance, inflation, poverty and refugees flying from various locations make expect a lean season worse than last year in most of the south regions. With the current situation, 0,99 million people are projected to be on Phase 3 and more in the post lean season by December 2022.

The cases were confirmed by utilizing the stool culture method, Rapid Diagnostic test and hanging drop test. The causal agent identified is Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa Serotype. Five patients are being treated in Sukraraj Tropical and infectious diseases hospital, Teku Kathmandu. In the Kathmandu valley, sporadic cases have been identified in different areas of main cities with dense populations and high mobility, where the first two cases reported from the Sukharaj Tropical and Infectious Diseases Hospital belonged to the same family. Initial field investigation conducted by a joint team from the Kathmandu District Health Office (DHO), Kathmandu Metropolitan Office, Epidemiology and Diseases Control Division (EDCD), Department of Food Technology and Quality Control and WHO revealed that the potential cause of Cholera cases in Kathmandu is the use of unboiled tap water for drinking. As with the majority of the valley’s population, the majority of cases have been linked to the consumption of commercial jar water. The presence of Escherichia coli in 38 of 53 water samples from the valley indicates that the majority of drinking water sources in the valley are contaminated with human faeces.

In Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas, people are returning to their places of origin or at least close to it to assess their livelihoods' condition. During the last weeks' receding waters were observed, particularly in affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan. In Sindh, water is receding in the districts of Kashmore, Kandhkot, Larkana, Ghotki, Sukkur, Tando Allahyar, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Umerkot and Sanghar. [...] In the flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan, outbreaks of water-borne and vector-borne diseases continue to increase, particularly due to the destruction of health facilities and standing water. The Government-led multi-sector rapid needs assessments (RNA) conducted in the worst-affected districts of Sindh indicated that thirty-seven per cent of key informants reported that the nearest health facility is not functional, and the ones who reported a health facility nearby stated the limited capacity of the facility. As of 5 October, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), close to 2,000 health facilities have been either damaged or destroyed. [...] The health situation is also exacerbated by the lack of adequate sanitation facilities. Large parts of Sindh remain flooded, with access continuing to be a challenge in inundated areas. An estimated 5.5 million people no longer have access to safe drinking water due to damages to water infrastructure and sanitation facilities. [...] The current floods have aggravated food insecurity and malnutrition in flood-affected areas. An estimated 14.6 million people require emergency food assistance from December through March 2023, representing an increase of more than 100 per cent of the pre-flood estimate. This includes 4 million people in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). ([OCHA, 14 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3896583/))

The monsoon rains continue to affect Pakistan by causing floods, landslides, flash floods, and severe weather-related incidents, which have resulted in a humanitarian emergency. Since mid-June, at least 1,730 people have died, of which 792 people died in Sindh Province (south-eastern Pakistan), 336 in Balochistan (south-western Pakistan), and 308 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (north-western Pakistan), according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Nearly 12,865 individuals have been injured across all Provinces of Pakistan and more than 33 Million people have been affected, of which 14.5 Million in Sindh, and 9.2 million in Balochistan. Widespread damage has been reported to over 2.2 million houses, more than 1.1 million livestock has been lost and more than 13,000 km of roads and 440 bridges have been affected. ([ECHO, 25 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3899781/))

Malaria cases are increasing due to the stagnant water, while the incidence of diarrhea is at least five times higher than usual, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, where more than 1 in 9 children under five admitted to health facilities suffered from severe acute malnutrition. More than 3.5 million children's education was interrupted due to the impact of floods. Some sectors noted inadequate funding and delays in supplies as a major gap in responding to the needs of hard-to-reach areas. Roughly only 15-20 per cent of the affected population has received relief assistance from humanitarians. ([OCHA, 29 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3901401/))

Public health concerns are high in flood-affected areas of Pakistan, particularly with access to primary healthcare limited by monsoon-induced damage to health facilities. As of 25 October, 59 health facilities are destroyed and 461 are partially damaged in Sindh, where nearly 350,000 people were suspected of having malaria, more than 700,000 people had diarrhea, and over 770,000 people reported a skin-related disease between July and early October. Stagnant water has contributed to malaria outbreaks in 32 districts in Sindh and Balochistan. The practice of open defecation has increased from one-fifth before the floods to over one-third of the affected population, with 6 million people no longer having home sanitation facilities. ([OCHA, 1 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3902021/))

As of 8 November, according to World Health Organization (WHO), around 8 million flood-affected people need health assistance. Vector-borne and water-borne diseases remain a major concern in flood-affected areas. Around 1,000 confirmed cholera cases and 64,767 dengue fever cases, with 147 deaths, have been reported. More than 5.1 million women are of reproductive age, including an estimated 410,846 pregnant women. Approximately 136,950 births are expected in the next three months. ([OCHA, 11 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3906187))

According to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), more than 33 million persons have been affected by the humanitarian emergency caused by the floods, about 1,739 people have died and almost 8 million people have been displaced. Widespread damage has been reported to critical infrastructure, houses and livestock. The findings from a recent ECHO field staff’s visit to flood-affected areas in Sindh and Balochistan show that the situation remains dire with great extensions of land still covered by water. At least 1.85 million people remain still displaced, living in roadside spontaneous camps in poor conditions. A serious concern remains that many of the people returning are moved to places with no infrastructure, no shelter and residing on elevated areas with flood waters around. ([OCHA, 28 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3911040))

Floodwaters continue to recede in many flood-affected areas across Pakistan. However, standing flood waters continue to be reported in Dadu, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) imagery indicates an estimated 8 million people still potentially exposed to floodwaters or living close to flooded areas. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 240,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 3 December, down from 6.5 million in early September. Nearly 90% of flood-displaced people are reportedly with host communities, while the remaining are in tent cities and relief camps. While receding flood waters have allowed millions of people to go home, there are reports of significant service gaps in areas of return, in addition to extensive impacts to homes, agriculture, and livelihoods. [...] A recent need and gaps analysis by partners in the food security sector indicates a persistent and increasing need for emergency food assistance moving into the first quarter of 2023. A failure to address this need would worsen the already frail food security situation and drive more people into crisis and emergency levels. The food security situation of an estimated additional 1.1 million people is deteriorating and are forecast to fall into IPC 4 (emergency food security phase)
between January-March 2023. Evidence from available data indicates that relief response to date has fallen well short of the need, with over 5.1 million people now experiencing IPC 4 conditions in flood-affected areas. ([OCHA, 5 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3913492))

During the monsoon season, rainfall was equivalent to nearly 2.9 times the national 30-year average, causing widespread flooding and landslides with severe repercussions for human lives, property, and infrastructure. An estimated 20.6 million people, including 9.6 million children, need humanitarian assistance. To date, 94 districts have been declared ‘calamity hit’ by the Government of Pakistan. Many of the hardest-hit districts are amongst the most vulnerable districts in Pakistan, where children already suffer from high malnutrition, poor access to water and sanitation, low school enrolment, and other deprivations. In mountainous and high altitude areas of Pakistan, many also affected by the floods, have received snowfall and temperatures have fallen below 0 Celsius, particularly in the northern and northwestern parts of Pakistan including Khyber Pakhtunkwa (KP), Gilgit Baltistan (GB), Pakistan Administered Kashmir (PAK) and northern Balochistan. ([UNICEF, 23 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3919294))

In some locations of Sindh province and in parts of Balochistan, water has yet to recede and may remain for several months, prolonging the dire humanitarian situation for people in these areas. Flood water remains stagnant in Dadu, Jacobabad, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 89,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 2 January 2023, down from 6.5 million in early September. The IDPs living in ten districts including Dadu, ShikarPur, Matiari, Mirpur Khas, Jaccobabad, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Thatta, Khairpur and Karachi with the highest number of IDPs in Dadu (41,742) and the lowest in Karachi (356 IDPs). ([OCHA, 6 Jan 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3922246))

Food security, livelihood-related assistance and public health are the biggest concerns: based on the latest analysis by UNOSAT, an estimated 4.5 million people remain exposed to or living close to flooded areas. More than 2.5 million people do not have access to safe or potable water. An estimated 1.1 million people are at risk of sliding from acute food and livelihood crisis (IPC3) situations to humanitarian emergency (IPC4) food security situations due to insufficient support. Malaria outbreaks have been reported in at least 12 districts of Sindh and Balochistan. More than 7 million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. An estimated 3.5 million children, especially girls, are at high risk of permanent school dropout. The Pakistan Floods Response Plan is only 36 per cent funded more than halfway through its 9-month duration. ([OCHA, 6 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3931198))

Camps housing internally displaced persons in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Punjab provinces have closed, while 29,692 people remain
displaced in Sindh province, with 5,132 people living in temporary tent cities or villages established by the District Disaster Management Authority. High food prices and a heavy reliance on imports continue to threaten Pakistan's food and nutrition security. Meanwhile, the 2022-2023 Rabi season, combined with the unstable availability of wheat flour, has resulted in significant price fluctuations and uncertainty affecting other essential goods’ prices. According to WFP monitoring data, the floods led to a 53 percent increase in new malnutrition cases from July 2022 to January 2023 amongst children enrolled in the 50 pilot facilitation centres of the *Benazir Nashonuma Programme*, the national social protection scheme aimed at improved health and nutrition. Additional funding is urgently required to treat Moderate and Acute Malnutrition (MAM) to prevent the progression to Severe Acute Malnutrition. ([WFP, 28 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3943897))

Six months after the Government of Pakistan declared a national emergency, approximately 1.8 million people are still living near contaminated and stagnant floodwater pools. Nutrition, food security and public health are the major concerns as many of these people are in temporary shelters, lack basic food items (at risk of sliding into emergency level of hungers) and increased cases of malnutrition. Besides other humanitarian needs in Sindh province, PDMA Sind has declared an urgent need for dewatering activities in the districts of Nausharo Feroze, Khairpur, Sukkur, Jhatta, and Ghotki. To achieve this, five excavators, dewatering pumps, and fuel are required to complete the dewatering process and provide the people in these areas with appropriate livelihood standards. ([OCHA, 9 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3942002))

There is a looming nutrition crisis: the number of children suffering from wasting in Pakistan’s flood-affected areas had greatly increased compared to the pre-flood situation, which was already reaching emergency levels. A rapid survey by UNICEF in 15 flood-affected districts reveals that one-third of children aged 6-23 months suffer from moderate acute malnutrition, and 14% suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening form of malnutrition. The rate of severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan is twice that of the South Asian region and four times higher than the global average. The United Nations in Pakistan dedicates US$5.5 million out of the US$6.5 million allocation received from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) towards emergency nutrition and food security interventions in flood impacted areas of Sindh and Balochistan. According to the latest WFP Market Monitor Report, Pakistan's Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the highest it has been in the past 49 years, having increased by 31.55 per cent in February 2023 compared to February 2022. Since April 2023, heavy rainfall and flashfloods have tragically caused the death of 19 people, injured more than 10, and destroyed properties, bridges, highways, crops, and livestock. ([OCHA, 8 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3961101))

Despite the passage of nearly a year since the floods, Pakistan is currently facing an imminent nutrition crisis, which has been aggravated by pre-existing high rates of malnutrition in flood-affected regions. Of particular concern is the increasing malnutrition among young children, as undernutrition accounts for nearly half of all deaths in children under five. Shockingly, one in five children under five in Pakistan suffer from wasting, with severe and moderate acute malnutrition rates at 8 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. The 84 districts affected by the 2022 monsoon flooding display distressing nutrition indicators. These districts have an average severe acute malnutrition rate of 12 percent, impacting over 3.5 million children. Among them, more than 1.45 million children require treatment with Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) due to severe wasting. [...] As of June 5, 2023, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) indicates that approximately 10.5 million people (29 percent of those analyzed) from 43 districts in vulnerable provinces of Pakistan are facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Within this population, around 2.1 million individuals (6 percent) are in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), while 8.4 million people (23 percent) are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). These areas, including Balochistan (18 districts), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (9 districts), and Sindh (16 districts), were severely affected by the monsoon rains and flooding in late 2022, which greatly impacted food production, consumption, livelihoods, and employment opportunities. ([OCHA, 13 Jun 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3970907))

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the first spell of monsoon rains in Pakistan during the period of 25 June to 10 July has resulted in 86 deaths, 151 injuries, damage to 97 houses, and the loss of 46 livestock. In Punjab province, Lahore City witnessed an exceptional volume of rainfall, setting a record for the highest levels observed in the past three decades. With over 200 mm of rainfall, the city faced significant urban flooding. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued warnings of more rains, wind-thunderstorm, land sliding in hilly areas and high-level flooding in rivers such as Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. It is important to note that the monsoon rains are exacerbating the already dire conditions faced by the communities that have been affected by the 2022 floods in Pakistan. Waterborne and vector-borne diseases remain a significant concern in flood-affected districts. 82 cases of Cholera were reported from 12 flood-affected districts.

Pacific: Drought - May 2022,"On 11 June, the **Kiribati** Government declared a State of Disaster due to drought. According to government sources, the entire country (some 120,000 people) has been affected - with the most critical situation to be reported on the island of Tarawa. The immediate response is to focus on 50,000 of the most affected people (about 40% of the country’s total population), including those living on South Tarawa and the outer islands. They will be provided with WASH and hygiene kits from prepositioned stocks and subsequently with further humanitarian relief supplies from warehouses in Suva, Fiji, and Brisbane, Australia. This follows an initial assistance of 100 solar distillation units for outer communities last week. The Pacific Humanitarian Team is working closely with Government counterparts and partners on the ground to further assess the situation and to provide support to the Government-led response. ([OCHA, 28 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3860981))

The drought in **Kiribati** continues to worsen, with increasing challenges and threats in terms of water contamination, brackish water, water accessibility and water availability. A situation report issued by the Government highlights that humanitarian needs of concern are primarily WASH and health-related. Water assessments covering 1,875 households in Betio, the largest township of Kiribati's capital city, South Tarawa, show that the water for 73% of tested households showed levels of contaminants, indicating that the contamination of drinking water in Betio is widespread. For the outer Islands, water assessments have not yet been conducted. However, reports from the majority of Island Councils point out that accessing freshwater is becoming increasingly difficult and that the prolonged drought has already taken a toll on livelihoods and food security of communities in these islands. Response efforts by Government include the technical assessments for water quality and the provision of safe drinking water to the general population. All relevant Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) regional clusters are in contact with respective line ministries/governmental counterparts as well as humanitarian partners on the ground to support the government-led effort.

La Niña conditions were observed in the equatorial Pacific starting in November 2021. Since then, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tokelau, and Nauru have experienced high water stress because of low rainfall and dry conditions. This situation is expected to persist as La Niña is predicted to continue until the last quarter of 2022. [...] In **Tuvalu**, two islands (Nanumea, Nui) have been declared in drought conditions, four (Nanumaga, Niutao, Nukufetu, Funafuti) are in drought warning, and three (Vaitupu, Nukulaelae, Niulakita) under drought watch (not included in beneficiary numbers). Some 9,200 people or 86% of Tuvalu’s population are under drought or drought warning conditions. The Government of Tuvalu has developed their drought response plan and have formally asked the UN for support. Their plans composed of two aspects: one is the immediate response which involves provision of reverse osmosis (RO) machines to generate fresh water in critical areas; and the other involves early anticipatory actions, including strategic deployment of RO units, conduct of household surveys and water soundings, maintenance of water storage and community wells, and WASH outreach targeting children.

Bangladesh: Floods and Landslides - May 2022,"Due to heavy rainfall over the past week in the Northeastern Indian states there is an increase of water level observed in the North Eastern part of Bangladesh which led a serious flood in that region. Mainly several places of the 5 districts in that region are inundated by excessive rainfall but Sylhet and Sunamganj district affected the most severally. Alongside with Government of Bangladesh several national and international agencies have already started providing support to the affected communities. According to latest update by Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), water is flowing above danger level (up to 1m) in several station of Surma and Kushiyara river at Sylhet and Sunamganj. [...] The forecast of FFWC shows that, flood situation may improve in the several areas of Sylhet where as situation may be worsen in the low lying area of Netrokona district. Many people in these areas are living in a very miserable life as they need emergency food and water support immediately. 

Around 2 million people have been impacted due to the flood. They are reeling from a food and drinking water crisis.

Heavy monsoon rains and water from upstream in India's northeast have inundated large parts of the Sylhet division, leaving millions of people marooned and triggering a humanitarian crisis. According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), around 94 percent of Sunamganj and over 84 percent of Sylhet are submerged. The crisis struck at a time when the people of the division were recovering from unexpected recent floods that hit in late May. An estimated 4.3 million people are impacted by this sudden flash flood and water congestion in seven northeastern districts of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulivazar, Habiganj, Netrakona, and Brahmanbaria. Many households are isolated due to floods, while some have taken shelter in open areas. The safety and security of women and girls in those households are at high risk. As many as 25,000 people have been taken to around 450 shelter centres in Sylhet; at the same time, 65,000 people were evacuated to 200 shelter centres in Sunamganj in a combined effort of the Army, Navy, Fire Service, and the local authorities.

From 15 May to 28 June, emergency shelter repair assistance was provided to 9,426 families (including bamboo, tarpaulins, rope and jute bags). Of these, 887 extremely vulnerable families were provided with additional assistance such as home deliveries of shelter materials and/or labour support to repair their shelters. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH): Immediate repairs have been conducted to 207 latrines, 95 bathing cubicles, 2 faecal sludge treatment plants (FSTPs), 17 handpump tube wells, 1 dam (water reservoir) and 2 solid waste management (SWM) sites throughout all the camps. Hygiene promotion activities are ongoing. ([ISCG, 30 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3863967/))

According to local authorities, the majority of the displaced families who have been housed in over 1,600 temporary shelters have returned to their homes. However, there are still 19,221 people including 3,229 children and 166 people with disability (PwD) living in 275 shelters in Sylhet and Sunamganj. Hundreds of families are reportedly staying with their relatives and extended family members while some others remain in common buildings. There are people living in remote sub-districts that remain hard to reach due to flooding and poor road infrastructures. Basic services, notably health facilities, are slowly returning to normal. The massive challenges remains in the WASH sector, the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) estimated that some 106,727 water points and 283,355 sanitation facilities have been immensely damaged, all needs restoration and reconstruction. Meanwhile, the risk of Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreaks, skin and respiratory diseases continue to be high. As of 13th July, 12,503 cases of waterborne diseases and other ailments have been reported in Sylhet division. ([UNICEF, 16 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3866893/))

Barsha is among the 3.5 million children whose lives have been disrupted by floods in north-eastern Bangladesh. Floodwaters in the affected districts have severely damaged almost 45,000 water points and 50,000 sanitation facilities, leaving sheltering families with no access to clean water or latrines. On top of the food shortage, increased risk of drowning, separation from families and violence, children are at increased risk of waterborne diseases.

Mothers are worried, as more children come down with diseases due to lack of clean water. As one mother explains: “We haven’t had clean water in days. My children have gotten sick in the shelter drinking dirty water.” ([UNICEF, 17 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3867379/))

As of 21 July, there are still 1,590 people, including 636 children, living in 53 shelters in Sylhet district. All families in Sunamganj have already left shelters. The families returning to their damaged homes and lacking access to basic services are in urgent need of multisectoral humanitarian assistance, focused on restoration of services they had before. ([UNICEF, 23 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3869165/))

As of 3 August, all families have left the flood shelters in Sylhet and Sunamganj district. They returned home and started caring for the homesteads, which got various damages. Most of the affected families shared their immediate needs in basic household items such as cooking utensils and furniture. They also explained their struggles to access the WASH facilities and lost livelihoods. Thousands of families could not save their crops, seeds, and fodders from the sudden surge of the flood water that stayed for days. Many affected families are now in search of alternative earnings to manage their daily meals. Over the past two weeks, there has been an increase in calls to the Child Helpline 1098, with more than 85 per cent of the calls from flood-affected areas being related to violence against children and women (VACW). As of 29 July, 19,918 cases of waterborne diseases and other ailments have been reported, and 74 people died, including 33 children in Sylhet division. The risk of Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreaks and skin and respiratory diseases continues to be high. In Sylhet and Sunamganj districts, 349 community clinics out of 505 have been affected by flash flood. Sunamganj, one of the most flood-affected areas, is also one of the districts lagging in education parameters. The high dropout rate in primary education and many out-of-school children pose the biggest challenge. More than 3,000 primary and secondary schools in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have been affected and remained closed for about a month, resulting in colossal learning loss for over 1.5 million learners. Schools urgently require extensive cleaning and repair work. ([UNICEF, 4 Aug 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3874152/))

As many as 472,856 people were taken to around 1,605 shelter centres in a combined effort of the Army, Navy, Fire Service, and local authorities, according to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR). Many households are isolated due to floods, while some have taken shelter in open areas. The safety and security of women and girls in those households are at high risk. The Department of Public Health and Engineering (DPHE) reported that 106,727 water points and 283,355 latrines were damaged. The Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries reported that 663,534 cattle were affected, and the Ministry of Agriculture reported that 254,251 hectors of croplands were damaged. [...] In support of the Government, the humanitarian community appealed for USD 58.4 million to respond to the emergency needs of the hardest-hit communities. A total of USD13.73 million was raised and 651,230 people were reached. Due to the limited resources, only 23.5% of the most vulnerable families were supported. ([UN RC Bangladesh & UNCT Bangladesh, 20 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3901485/))

According to the MoDMR, the estimated loss of the housing sector is USD 176.0 million. The Flash Flood caused damage to 254,251 hectares of croplands and affected 663,534 cattle, 106,000 ponds inundated, and 17,000 metric tons of fish washed away. The total damage in the agriculture and livestock sector is US$ 230.8 million. An estimated 4.2 million people suffered disruption to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services -106,727 water points and 283,355 latrines were damaged. The overall damage and loss in the WASH sector is estimated at USD 55.7 million. Agriculture, livestock rearing, and fisheries are the key income sources of north-eastern population. Based on the detailed household assessment conducted by BDRCS in December 2022, only 2.3 per cent of assessed households in Sylhet and Sunamganj district can fully recover their livelihood, while only 7 per cent of assessed families can reconstruct their damaged houses and 9 per cent of assessed families can rebuild their damaged latrines.

Tanzania: Cholera Outbreak - Apr 2022,"On 23 April 2022, the government reported cholera cases in Uvinza DC (Kigoma region) and Tanganyika DC (Katavi region). By 28 April 2022, the outbreak had spread to other areas along the lake shores of Lake Tanganyika with a total of 129 symptomatically suspected cases, of which eight were confirmed. Most of the affected locations are fishing villages with poor sanitation practices that include open defecation and densely populated areas which lack adequate sanitation with poor access to clean and safe water, posing a danger for further spread of the epidemic. Zero fatalities have been reported to date. ([IFRC, 19 May 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3848854))

The [DR] Congo today kicked off Ebola vaccination in Mbandaka, the capital city of Equateur Province in the north-west, to halt the spread of the virus following an outbreak which has claimed two lives since 21 April. Around 200 doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine have been shipped to Mbandaka from the eastern city of Goma. More doses will be delivered progressively in the coming days. The vaccination uses the “ring strategy” where the contacts and the contacts of contacts of confirmed Ebola patient are given the vaccine as well as frontline and health workers. So far, 233 contacts have been identified and are being monitored. Three vaccination teams are already on the ground and will work to reach all the people at high risk. To date, two cases, both deceased, have been confirmed since the outbreak began. The disease has currently been reported only in Mbandaka health district.

Liberia: Measles Outbreak - Apr 2022,"On Thursday 21 April 2022, Liberia Health Ministry declared a measles outbreak affecting 14 of the 15 counties in the country. According to the Liberian Government, the outbreak is a result of low immunization rates, due to disruption of immunization activities for COVID-19 and people’s misconception on immunization. According to the Liberian Ministry of Health (MoH), the case threshold for measles outbreak corresponds to three to five cases reported in a single location in seven days. Per the National Public Health Institute’s weekly update on Liberia Public Health Surveillance & Response System, covering the period 4-10 April 2022 (Report week 14) Montserrado County only accounted for 135 cases and 03 deaths. Moreover, two County Health Teams, Nimba and Grand Bassa reported on 22 April respectively 230 and 91 cases.

Zambia: Cholera Outbreak - Apr 2022,"On 11 April 2022, a cholera outbreak was declared in Zambia with its index case reported in Mtendere compound which has a population of 106,128 within Chelstone Subdistrict and Matero with a population of 356,462, within Lusaka. By 18 April 2022, the outbreak had spread to other areas within Lusaka with a cumulative total of 16 suspected cases of which 8 were confirmed, distributed as follows: Lusaka Province – 7 (Lusaka District 12; - Mtendere 4, Kabangwe 1, Kamwala 1 and Matero 1), Chilanga District (Midles-west 2, Apolo1, and ZESCO Kalundu 2) Northern Province 5 (Nsama District – Nsumbu 5). These are densely populated areas which lack adequate sanitation and access to clean and safe water, posing a danger for further spread of the epidemic. No fatalities have been reported to date. 

Although this cholera outbreak has occurred outside the rainy season, it has the potential to mimic the 2017-2018 outbreak, which started in one area and spread to other hotspots within Lusaka, and eventually to other parts of the country. Already, there are reports of suspected cases in Nsumbu area in Nsama District in Northern Province, and the Ministry of Health is yet to rule out epidemiological link between the two events through a risk assessment and patients record tracking. Once the risk assessment report is shared with partners, it will become clearer regarding the situation and gaps in the response strategy. However, MoH has put in place systems for the response and a Lusaka Provincial multi-sectoral response plan is being finalised and will be shared with relevant stakeholders.

Zambia faces challenges to attain universal access to safe and clean drinking water, as well as inadequate sanitation, especially in densely populated and unplanned settlements in urban settings. These conditions, coupled with the poor hygiene practices among citizens, has caused recurrent outbreaks of WASH related diseases. To note, although Cholera is endemic in Zambia, the country has not had an outbreak since 2019 owing to various cholera preventive interventions being implemented within the context of the country’s Multi-sectoral Cholera Elimination Plan.

DR Congo: Plague Outbreak - Apr 2022,"On 4 April 2022, the Provincial Health Division (DPS) of the province of Ituri declared a resurgence of the Bubonic Plague epidemic in the health zone of Rethy, in the territory of Djugu. According to the authorities, the history of this disease in the Rethy health zone goes back to more than 9 outbreaks, including this one. The eighth one dates back to January 2022 in the UKETHA health area. On 7 April 2022, the epidemiological situation covering 26 March to 4 April was as follows from DPS data: 31 notified cases of which only 15 have been tested, 2 deaths and nearly 2,000 contacts listed in the absence of local reactivity. The epicenter of the plague disease is in the Health Areas of Lokpa, Rassia, and Uketha, where the 3 confirmed cases are located. These three health areas are in the Rethy health zone, Djugu territory, in ITURI Province.

Between 4 and 16 April 2022, 27 suspected cases in addition to the above were notified by the Lokpa Health Centre but in the absence of testing, the confirmation of cases remains very low and the level of vulnerability is underestimated. The absence of partners in the Rethy Health Zone apart from the local branch of the DRC Red Cross, MEDAIR, and MALTESER, as well as the lack of materials, greatly limits the response and the establishment of effective disease control and containment system. 

This health zone of Rethy is in a permanent state of insecurity, which is at the root of the lack of partners and is subject to the internal displacement of the population. Populations fled Rethy to Fataki in 2021 following clashes from November to December and then from Fataki to Rethy following attacks in Rethy between armed groups in February 2022. There is a likelihood that population flows are linked to cases and/or influence the spread of the disease. In the Ngri Mandefu Health areas, for example, 8,306 were displaced to the Mbr'bu, Bale, and Gudjo Health Areas, following clashes between the military and armed men in Dhera locality on 30 March. In total, the Rethy Health Zone has 60,875 IDPs from other health areas according to an OCHA report of 7 March 2022, and 59,921 people who had left Rethy and have now returned.

Sri Lanka: Food Security Crisis - 2022-2023,"The significant reduction in agricultural production in Sri Lanka, compounded by the rising prices of fuel and basic food items, have made food unaffordable for a segment of the population, and the government has forecasted food shortages during the next months. It is estimated that only 24 per cent of the usually worked land has been cultivated for the upcoming season. Surveys indicate that up to 70 per cent of households have had to reduce food consumption as food prices have reportedly increased by 73 per cent in the last two years.

Hospitals in the country report shortages of essential medicines and other health items, while frequent power outages affect the delivery of health services. The shortage of medicines has paralyzed about 50 per cent of medical operations in the country. The multi-dimensional crisis in Sri Lanka has inevitably brought more protection issues to the pre-existing chronic inequalities experienced by its people. An estimated 5.7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 25 districts across the country. ([OCHA, 9 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3854909/))

The United Nations has launched a US$47.2 million plan for the period June through September, to respond to the Government’s request for support. The Government announced a two-week shutdown of government services and schools in Colombo to reduce the number of people taking private and public transportation as fuel stocks are predicted to run out in five days. In health, currently close to 200 essential medicines are now out of stock, with a predicted shortage of another 163 critical over the next two to three months. Additionally, over 2,700 essential surgical and more than 250 regular laboratory items are also out of stock. Due to power cuts and the lack of fuel to operate generators, many hospitals have had to postpone non-urgent surgeries and procedures. WFP has activated an emergency response to the food crisis, focusing on urgent programmes to save lives and mitigate growing food insecurity among 3 million of the most vulnerable people of Sri Lanka from June through December 2022.

The population continues to feel the brunt of the economic and food crises. About 3 in 10 households (6.26 million people) are food insecure, 65,600 of which are severely food insecure, according to WFP’s latest food security assessment. Food inflation is alarmingly high at 57.4 percent in June 2022. Steeply increasing food prices have crippled the population’s ability to put sufficient and nutritious food on the table. The majority of assessed households (61 percent) are regularly employing food-based coping strategies such as eating less preferred and less nutritious food, and reducing the amount of food they eat. Two in five households are not consuming adequate diets. ([WFP, 6 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3863475/))

Household food security and the nutrition situation in Sri Lanka is set to deteriorate as the economic crisis ensues, according to WFP and FAO’s recent Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM). Nationally, 6.3 million people were found to be food insecure (28.3 percent). Of these, at least 65,600 people are severely food insecure. Skyrocketing food costs are making it harder for the population to meet their food needs. Incomes in the last three months have plummeted. About two in five households reported that their income has been cut in half. To cope with the lack of food, 5 million people are using crisis or emergency livelihood coping strategies that are likely to impact their medium to long-term capacity for income-generating activities and food security.

Partners were also able to disburse over US$ 2.2 million of cash assistance and reach over 102,000 people with in-kind food assistance. Other life-saving initiatives are being rolled out across the sectors of food security, agriculture, nutrition, water, protection, education, and health to address urgent needs. ([OCHA, 20 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3888013/))

Sri Lanka continues to face a multidimensional crisis compounded by food insecurity, threatened livelihoods, shortages of vital and essential medicines, as well as rising protection concerns. The economic crisis is the worst since Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948 and is having humanitarian consequences for the most vulnerable people in the country. A 40 percent reduction in agricultural outputs in the 2021/2022 Maha and 50 percent reduction during the 2022 Yala seasons have further exacerbated the situation. Forecasts for the 2022/2023 Maha season indicate a significantly reduced harvest as well, which coupled with a food inflation of 85.6 percent in October, means that a significant part of the population is finding it difficult to meet basic needs. [...] Recognizing the continuing humanitarian needs, it was agreed that the Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) plan will be extended until the end of 2022, complementing existing emergency operations carried out by the UN and humanitarian partners. Focusing on life-saving priorities for the most vulnerable people, the HNP revision will increase the number of people being targeted to 3.4 million across all sectors. ([OCHA, 7 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3904353/))

According to WFP’s recent Household Food Security Survey in October 2022, over three in ten households (36 percent) are food-insecure. Over seven in ten households are adopting food-based coping strategies such as eating less preferred food, continuing the alarming trend observed since June. Meanwhile, eight in ten households are turning to livelihood-based coping strategies such as selling productive assets, the highest observed since June. ([WFP, 5 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3914024/))

According to WFP, in December 2022 around 37 per cent of households were food insecure, a slight increase compared to the previous month (36 per cent). Recently completed nutrition assessments also indicate a worsening situation with preliminary findings from the recently concluded micronutrient survey undertaken by the Medical Research Institute (MRI) of Sri Lanka with the support of WFP and UNICEF showing an increase in cases of acute malnutrition among children. [...] The next few months are critical as Sri Lanka is now in the lean season and the Maha harvest in March/April will be an
important indicator with regards to the overall food security situation. [...] There has been a concerning trend of increased migration reported nationwide, leading to family separations and more admission requests to children’s homes. Budget constraints and government staff shortages exacerbate protection concerns. ([OCHA, 17 Jan 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3924633/))

While there are some positive indicators, such as modest decreases in both the overall inflation (year-on-year) and food inflation (year-on-year), the economic and humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka remains highly volatile. According to WFPs latest Household Food Security Survey, 33 per cent of households were facing acute food insecurity in December 2022, with 68 per cent of people resorting to food-based coping strategies such as limiting portions and reducing the number of meals eaten per day. Particularly affected are households in the estate sector as well as female-headed households,
where 38 per cent and 37 per cent are food-insecure respectively. Several assessments indicate a deteriorating nutritional situation primarily affecting young children, and recently it was announced that non-essential surgeries at government hospitals would be delayed due to shortages of medicines and medical equipment. Challenges with regards to protection services and education also remain, with increased reports on admission requests to children’s homes and an increasing trend of migration and family separations. [...] The next few months remain critical; Sri Lanka is currently in the agricultural lean season, the outcome of the next *Maha* harvest remains sub-optimal, and uncertainty on the debt-restructuring and subsequent IMF loan. ([OCHA, 15 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3934340/))

As of 15 March 2023, some 1,246,000 people have received in kind food or cash and voucher assistance. 973,000 people received agriculture and livelihoods support and 2.3 million people received nutritional support, primarily through school meals. About 805,000 people benefitted from WASH interventions, while 311,000 and 564,000 people benefitted from Health and Education assistance, respectively. The number of people who benefitted from Protection related interventions saw the most marked increase during this reporting period, going up to 60,000 from 48,000. Developments over the next few months will affect the scope and scale of future humanitarian interventions. The *Maha* harvest is currently in progress, and while yields are likely to be higher than the last *Maha* harvest, thanks to the largescale provision of fertilizers and other agricultural inputs, there will still be some shortcomings, and the price of rice and other essential food items will remain high due to increased production costs. This means that for many households, food
insecurity will remain. [...] Another issue to be closely watched is the US$2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility of the IMF. At present, Sri Lanka is seeing an increase in public protests, with many people upset about income tax increases, the high cost of living, increased electricity costs and various other issues. Several professional unions have called for strike action, including port workers, government hospital doctors and state bankers. The National Elections have also been postponed with a new date yet to be confirmed. ([OCHA, 15 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3943969/))

Food security in Sri Lanka is improving across all provinces, according to the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report. The report estimates 3.9 million people or 17 percent of the population is in moderate acute food insecurity which is nearly a 40 percent decrease from June/July last year. Nearly 10,000 people are severely acute food-insecure, down from 66,000 people last year. [...] Despite this positive trend, food insecurity remains high in certain districts, especially Kilinochchi, Nuwara Eliya, Mannar, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, and Jaffna. The highest level of acute food insecurity was found within the tea plantation communities in the Estate sector and among daily wage labourers and households who rely on social assistance programmes, such as Samurdhi, as their main source of income.

Tunisia: Flash Floods - Mar 2022,"On Saturday 19 March and following recent climatic fluctuations, torrential rain hit the northwest of Tunisia. According to Tunisia’s National Institute of Meteorology, the centre of the country and central-west regions including Siliana, Kairouan, Gafsa, Sidi Bouzid, Jendouba, Beja, El Kef, and Kasserine, recorded 60 mm and 80 mm of rain over four days, to locally reach an accumulative level 120 mm of rain. The country’s Civil Protection announced the death of an elderly woman in the governorate of Siliana and a second person is missing in the governorate of Kairouan. TRC teams reported three destroyed houses in Kairouan and two in Siliana as an impact of the heavy rain.

Consequently, floodwater surged through many different districts, damaging infrastructure, houses, properties, and livelihoods in the affected areas. Moreover, crops and fruit trees were damaged by the heavy rain, and electricity has been cut off in some districts. 

Based on the TRC rapid assessments conducted in coordination with the local authorities, more than 4,000 people have been affected by the floods. Some of them fled their homes seeking shelter in neighbouring high-ground houses and villages, while others opted to stay in their damaged houses and move to rooftops rather than risk crossing flooded areas to reach evacuation points. Water supply through pipelines is limited, and some of the water available in some areas is contaminated.

Djibouti: Drought - Mar 2022,"The ongoing drought and compounding regional and international shocks resulting in high price volatility are affecting the food security and nutrition situation in Djibouti. Rural populations in Ali Sabieh, Arta, Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil are particularly exposed to extreme deprivation and no longer able to cope due to lack of access to main basic services as water, health, and education. Malnutrition rates are almost double from last year in at least one health center visited by DG ECHO in May 2022. Communities report the depletion of livestock assets, loss of body mass index, and lack of milk production followed by death of livestock. According to the latest IPC, approximately 13% of the population (132,000 people) is facing acute food insecurity (IPC3) and is in need of immediate assistance. Projections indicate an increase in food insecurity to 16% of the population by December 2022. ([ECHO, 7 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3854203))

IPC projections for July to December 2022 indicate an increase in the number of acutely food insecure people, likely reaching 192,168 people, representing 16% of analysed population (1.2 million people, which is about the entire country). The number of people in emergency (IPC 4) will likely increase 12,390 people, a 250% rise from the current numbers, while the 179,778 people could be in crisis (IPC 3).

Current IPC analysis for the period of March to June 2022, highlight that approximately 132,000 people, representing 11% of the analysed population (of nearly 1.2 million people), are estimated to be acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 3 and 4). More precisely, an estimated 5,000 people (less than one percent of the population analysed) are estimated to already be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and approximately 127,000 people (11% of the population analysed) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([IFRC, 1 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3862372))

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), about 285 000 people are estimated to face severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 [Crisis] and IPC Phase 4 [Emergency]) in the July‑December 2023 period. This figure, which includes about 185,000 people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 100,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), amounts to about one‑quarter of the country’s population and it is almost 50 percent higher on a yearly basis.The high prevalence and severity of acute food insecurity and the deterioration of the food security situation are mainly due to the lingering impact of a prolonged and severe drought, which affected livelihoods between late 2020 and early 2023, and resulted in a reduction of livestock numbers by about 50 percent due to widespread deaths, severely constraining incomes and availability of livestock products for pastoralist households.([FAO, 07 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3986886))

Malawi has been grappling with the worst cholera outbreak in its history, which since its start in March 2022 has caused 1,768 fatalities and 60,000 registered cases (as of 4 October 2023). With sporadic cases still being registered, there are concerns that the outbreak could worsen again when the rainy season commences in November. The country also faces endemic malaria and a re-emergence of such vaccine-preventable diseases as polio, contributing to the need for response programmes that are fit for this polycrisis context. With reduced access to health care, WASH and nutrition services due to damaged health-care facilities and underlying economic challenges, disease outbreaks, especially cholera, could continue into the next rainy season. In view of the projected El Niño weather pattern and the anticipated poor food security outcomes – coupled with high poverty rates, the existing vulnerabilities especially in the southern areas affected by Tropical Cyclone Freddy, and the ongoing economic downturn – UNICEF is anticipating that the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance could rise to 9.4 million in 2024. Urgent action is required to protect livelihoods, reduce the deterioration of the nutrition situation and prevent the resurgence of a widespread cholera outbreak.

Central African Republic: Fires - Feb 2022,"Two large villages located 15 km from the city of Bakala (458 km from Bangui) experienced fires in the night of 24 to 25 February 2022, which caused significant material and human damages. This area is experiencing intense drought and very high temperatures at the end of the dry season, between February and March. Moreover, this is the period during which fields go up in flames due to dryness. The fire started from these burnt fields, spreading through the fields and vegetation to the buildings around. Fire quickly spread to other nearby houses and was aggravated by the strength of the dry winds specific to the season and the savannah area. [...] The fire continued until the night of 26 February 2022. After a few hours of calm, the fire started again on 28 February 2022, affecting other villages. The rapid assessment made by volunteers and local authorities on 27 February after the first fires shows 191 families directly affected by fires, i.e., 955 people, including 171 men, 385 women and 399 children. In this population, 11 pregnant women, 12 nursing mothers, 36 elderly people and 17 disabled people were recorded. After the fires from 28 February in new villages, Central African Red Cross Society (CARCS) carried out a jointly rapid assessment with the heads of villages and neighbourhoods on 1rst March which brought the total number of affected households to 503 within 6 villages with 28 partially destroyed houses and 17 injured.

Malawi: Polio Outbreak - Feb 2022,"The health authorities in Malawi have declared an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 after a case was detected in a young child in the capital Lilongwe. This is the first case of wild poliovirus in Africa in more than five years after Africa was declared free of indigenous wild polio in August 2020. Laboratory analysis shows that the strain detected in Malawi is linked to the one that has been circulating in Sindh Province in Pakistan. WHO is supporting the Malawi health authorities to carry out a risk assessment and outbreak response, including supplemental immunization. Surveillance of the disease is also being ramped up in neighbouring countries. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Rapid Response Team which is based at the WHO Regional Office in Africa is deploying a team to Malawi to support coordination, surveillance, data management, communications, and operations.

Cabo Verde: Drought - Feb 2022,"Since 2017, the country has been facing one of the worst drought crises since the 1990s. Rains continue to be rare, and production does not even cover 1% of the country's food needs. The 2021-2022 agro-pastoral campaign was characterized by a late start and an early end to the rains throughout the national territory. Overall agricultural production varies from low to nil. As a result, the Government of Cape Verde has declared, on 16 February 2022, the situation of national drought emergency disaster. 

Given the adverse conditions linked to the agro-pastoral agricultural campaign, some municipalities in the country are in a situation of acute food insecurity. The results of the Harmonized Framework (March 2022) show a current situation of food insecurity affecting 29,421 people in the phase of crisis (Ph 3), and 1,076 people in the emergency phase (Ph 4), mainly on the island of Santiago (in the municipality of Ribera Grande, which was the only one recorded in phase 3), and a projected situation for this year's lean period (June to August 2022) of 46,093 people in food insecurity (10% of the population) including 43,003 in crisis (Ph 3) and 3,090 in the emergency phase (Ph 4). ([IFRC, 26 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3841304))

Already severely affected by Covid-19 and drought, compounded with the effects of the war in Ukraine, Cabo Verde is struggling with a deteriorating socio-economic crisis. On 20 June, the government declared a social and economic emergency. Inflation reached 8 per cent, according to data from May, while in 2021 it was at 1.9 per cent around the same period of the year. With the loss of purchasing power, nine out of 100 Cabo Verdeans are at risk of food insecurity while in 2020, during the pandemic, they were only 2 per cent said the Prime Minister, Ulisses Correia e Silva, during a press conference in the capital Praia. By declaring a social and economic emergency, the government intends to obtain more support from the international community to continue financing the measures to protect families and businesses, he explained..  ([OCHA, 23 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3859593))

The number of people affected by food insecurity in Cabo Verde is set to spike with more than 46,000 women, men and children – almost 10 percent of the population - facing an acute deterioration in food security between June and August this year. This represents a threat to the country’s hard-won gains in food security over recent years forcing the Government to declare a social and economic national emergency on 20 June. If not urgently addressed, this will severely disrupt food access and agricultural production, putting more lives at risk as the country depends largely on imports to meet its food needs.

Tropical Cyclone Emnati has passed Mauritius and the French territory of La Reunion and is forecast to reach Madagascar on Tuesday, 22 February, in the late evening. Emnati will be the fifth extreme weather event this year, and fourth tropical storm to make landfall in Madagascar in one month, following [Tropical Storm Ana (22 January)](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/st-2022-000088-moz), [Tropical Cyclone Batsirai (5 February)](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2022-000160-mdg), [Tropical Storm Dumako (15 February)](https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/51059), and an inter-tropical convergence zone which impacted Madagascar on 17 January.

Response efforts are ongoing, led by the Government with support from humanitarian partners. ([OCHA, 22 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3820118))

Emnati passed through areas that were impacted by Tropical Cyclone Batsirai just 18 days ago, bringing 109 mm of rainfall to Mananjary alone. The weather system then weakened as it crossed land, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the south-east of Madagascar, including the Grand Sud region which has been suffering from an extremely severe drought. Given how dry the land is in these areas, there are concerns regarding the risk of flash floods. The weather system left Madagascar at 9 p.m. on 23 February from Ampanihy district. Ahead of the storm, about 45,000 people were preventatively evacuated to 130 shelters sites in 7 regions, mainly in Mahanoro, Mananjary, Manakara and Farafangana towns, according to the BNGRC. BNGRC and partners have started aerial assessments today, with logistics support from the World Food Programme, Medair and the private sector. Although Emnati made landfall as a Category 2 cyclone (while Batsirai was Category 3), early reports indicate flooding, damage and destruction in areas the storm passed through, with some communities—including Midongy du Sud—stranded by floodwaters. Several roads have been cut-off by flooding, fallen trees or landslides, particularly in the districts of Ambovombe, Farafangana, Ihosi, Midongy, Vohipeno and Vondrozo.

Tropical storm Ana made landfall in Angoche district, Nampula province on 24 January and subsequently headed westwards, affecting the northern part of Zambezia province and the southern part of Tete province [,,,] According to INGD, the storm already resulted in some 4,000 people affected, 66 people injured and five people killed. A total of 546 private houses were also partially destroyed while 115 were totally destroyed. Moreover, one health center and 16 classrooms were affected. On 25 January, a general power cut has been reported in the provinces of Zambezia, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado, following damages caused on the main electricity line. In Tete province, the bridge over the Rovubue river, between Tete Sede and Moaztize, collapsed due to the heavy flow of water. In Nampula, the connection between Nampula Sede and Angoche has been interrupted due to the overflow of the Luazi River. In Zambezia, the Licungo River exceeded the alert level, causing moderate to high floods in the districts of Mocuba, Maganja da Costa, and Namacurra. Moreover, several roads are under the water and two bridges have been destroyed between Mocuba and Lugela. Over the past 24 hours, tropical storm Ana turned into a tropical depression system, according to the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM). However, serious concerns remain about widespread floods, displacements, damages to critical public infrastructures, private houses as well as the interruption of basic services, as heavy rains and strong winds continue to hit.

Afghanistan: Earthquake - Jan 2022,"A 5.3 magnitude earthquake struck in Qadis District, Badghis Province in the Western Region of Afghanistan at 16:10 local time (UTC+4:30) on 17 January 2022. The earthquake was preceded by a smaller earthquake and was felt in Badghis, Ghor and Hirat Provinces. The earthquake reportedly resulted in human casualties and damages to homes and infrastructure in Qadis District, Badghis Province […] Initial reports indicate that 26 people were reportedly killed, four people injured, and hundreds of houses were damaged or destroyed. Heavy rains in the area prior to the earthquake reportedly rendered mud brick houses more vulnerable to damage. ([OCHA, 18 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3809033))

The preliminary estimate by the inter-agency team is that up to 1,000 houses were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake. According to the information received from the local sources, the number of deaths due to the earthquake have risen to 27 people. People in affected areas are using water wells that are unsafe. In Badrawak village, there are concerns for the potential of landslides on hills on both sides of the community with a population of 2,520 people (360 families). On 20 January, another earthquake struck in the areas, leading to the death of one person. Residents in the area remain very concerned about further earthquakes. Many are too afraid of going into their homes and are currently living under the makeshifts/traditional tents in cold weather conditions. As of 20 January, the joint assessment team has assessed 742 families and identified 434 families requiring humanitarian aid, while further assessments are ongoing within the affected areas. ([OCHA, 21 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3810310/))

Due to the winter season, the areas affected had experienced rain for two days before the initial earthquake, with temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius, compromising the structural integrity of the building structures, which are mostly made from mud. Those who have either lost their houses or have had their houses damaged by the earthquake face an extreme environment. At the same time, they are also coping with a lack of access to food, winter supplies, and an economic downturn. The anticipated needs of the affected population, which are currently being assessed and confirmed are food, clean water, shelter, sanitation facilities, hygiene items and household items. As of 22 January, based on the latest update, 1,254 households were assessed by the joint assessment team, out of which 834 households were identified for assistance.

Tonga: Volcanic Eruption and Tsunami - Jan 2022,"The eruption of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano on 15 January 2022 was the largest recorded since the 
eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. The eruption triggered tsunami waves of up to 15m which struck the west coast of 
Tongatapu, ‘Eua and Ha’apai. Ashfall covered an area of at least five square kilometres. 

Damage to the international and domestic undersea telecommunications meant little information was available
from Tonga following the eruption. However, New Zealand Defence Force and Australian Defence Forces 
surveillance flights on 17 January showed significant damage to houses, roads, water tanks and other infrastructure 
on the west coast of Tongatapu, the Ha’apai island group and the west coast of ‘Eua. On 18 January, the Prime 
Minister of Tonga declared a state of emergency effective from 16 January. The Tongan Government and TRCS 
requested international assistance. 

Only three direct and one indirect fatality have been officially attributed to the volcano and tsunami. Early 
government estimates were that 84,176 people (84 per cent of the population) on Tongatapu, Ha’apai and ‘Eua) were
affected, particularly by ashfall. Around 3,000 people were displaced in the immediate aftermath, including some 
evacuated from seriously affected islands off the coast of Tongatapu and in the Ha’apai island group. Most
subsequently returned to their communities, although some families evacuated from badly affected islands remain 
on Tongatapu. ([IFRC, 2 Aug 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3871884/))

Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) has since confirmed 3 positive cases out of 6 samples from the sub-county. As of 23 Jan, a total of 15 patients presenting fever, jaundice, muscle pain and fever pain (13 males and two females) were line-listed; and three deaths were recorded. A total of three cases turned out positive out of six samples analyzed. The majority of the cases are between 11 years-40 years (82.41 and are reported to come from Merti (bordering Wajir) and Garba Tulla (bordering Garissa) sub-counties. Unconfirmed reports later this week have indicated a possibility of new cases in Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet. The Ministry of Health reported an outbreak and issued an alert on 3 March received to all the 47 counties and initiated a response both at the County and national levels on 4 March. 

As a response, the Ministry of Health is initiating a national vaccination campaign starting with Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, West Pokot, Turkana, Mandera, and Tana River. Yellow fever vaccine is an effective public health prevention intervention and is offered as a scheduled routine vaccine for children aged nine months in four counties in Kenya (Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Turkana, and Baringo). 

The first cases of **Chikungunya** were reported in mid-February 2022 in Kotulo within Wajir County. Between February 10th and 24th, 23 samples from the suspected cases were collected and analyzed at KEMRI Nairobi laboratory, out of these, five samples tested positive for the Chikungunya virus, this is from the Ministry of health rapid assessment report. A rapid assessment team by MoH and County Government was deployed to the affected area by the Wajir county department of health. The team visited 50 households from different villages that were suspected to be having patients suffering from Chikungunya. The team identified 16 patients with symptoms of Chikungunya disease. The 15 samples were sent to the KEMRI laboratory for investigation. The team has since
line-listed a total of 67 cases in which five are confirmed and 53 are probable cases in which most of the cases are
epidemiologically linked to the confirmed cases from MoH/KEMRI above. Wargadud Ward in Tarbaj Sub-County is

The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) has activated the National Emergency Operations Committee (NEOC) in Majuro on 1 February 2022. The NEOC initially developed the Immediate Drought Response Plan in response to the critical conditions reported from 14 neighbouring islands/communities, including Aur, Ailuk, Jaluit, Lae, Lib, Likiep, Maloelap, Mejit, Wotho, Wotje, Mejjato/Ebadon, Utrok, Ujae, Namdrik, Jabot, Ailinglaplap and Namu. 

Many islands have two to four weeks of water left if no rain falls. Rains are predicted to return around midto-late March based on all guidance, including long-range model output, and there are expectations for waning La Nina conditions in the next few months. It is anticipated that even if rain starts to fall now, for the most drought-affected atolls/islands, the current impact of the drought condition will continue for several months. It will take months for water sources to replenish, water quality to improve, and lost crops to be replanted and harvested. Droughts are especially damaging in the atolls lacking sufficient rainwater harvesting/storage capacity to withstand dry periods, as with most of the outer atolls of the dry north.

Severe Tropical Storm Kompasu - Oct 2021,"On 7 October, a Low-Pressure Area East of Camarines Norte developed into a tropical depression while moving erratically over the Philippine Sea, and on the following day intensified into a Tropical Storm called Kompasu (locally known as Maring). On 10 October, Tropical Storm Kompasu merged with a Tropical Depression (locally known as Nando) and continued moving towards the Extreme Northern Luzon. 

On 11 October, Tropical Storm Kompasu intensified into Severe Tropical Storm (STS) and passed close to south of Camiguin Island, after which it made a landfall in the vicinity of Fuga Island, Cagayan in Region II. It further enhanced the southwest monsoon, bringing more rain to already inundated areas and causing heavy flooding in Cagayan Valley, MIMAROPA and Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). Although, the Severe Tropical Storm exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on Tuesday 12 October, further heavy rains were experienced. 

National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council has reported a total of 235 flooded areas and 31 incidents of rain-induced landslides in Regions I, II, III, MIMAROPA, CARAGA and CAR. Flooding up to waist level has been caused by continuous rains and the high saturation of soil moisture.

Honduras: Wildfires - Oct 2021,"On Saturday, 2 October 2021, around 2:00 a.m., a fire of significant proportions was reported in the municipality of Guanaja, Department of Islas de la Bahía, located 70 km north of the Honduran coast and 12 km from the island of Roatan with an approximate population of 6,000 inhabitants. The incident occurred in the town known as ""El Cayo"", the main population center of the municipality and where the municipal offices, health center, banks, and other commercial and government buildings are located. To date, the causes of the fire are still unclear. There was no Fire Department in the affected areas. Therefore, there was not a speedy response to the incident. According to reports from the Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO), the fire was 100% controlled around 11:00 a.m. on 2 October, thanks to the deployment of firefighters from the near island of Roatan (located between the islands of Útila and Guanaja) and the regions near the coast of the country of La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa, including members of the Honduran Naval Force and Air Force, which provided boats and helicopters to quell the spread of the fire. There is a long distance, between Guanaja and the main cities; hence supporting a speedy response was not possible (Guanaja – La Ceiba 123 km, Guanaja – Tegucigalpa 299 km).

Due to the proximity of the houses and wood as main construction material, the fire spread quickly, affecting approximately half of the territorial extension of El Cayo. The first reports indicated that the consequences of the event account for a total population of approximately 4,000 people broadly affected (2,500 directly affected), more than 500 evacuees, 90 homes destroyed, 136 homes damaged and 3 injured who were transferred by air to the University School Hospital located in Tegucigalpa; no deaths have been reported.

According to preliminary reports on the ground, some shelters were set up in the sector by the Guanaja Municipal Emergency Committee. However, only two people have been registered in them since most of the inhabitants have sought to move to other temporary places in communities inside or outside the municipality. The affected population has sought accommodation through houses of relatives, close people, hotels, and others. On the other hand, the central and municipal government has announced that it will begin as soon as possible the cleaning actions in the area that include the demolition and removal of those buildings that have suffered serious damage and could not be rehabilitated.

Iraq: Drought - Aug 2021,"In the region, Euphrates & Tigris rivers are currently experiencing drought conditions, resulting in lower river flow, and affecting dam storage. The current season is the second driest in 40 years. Iraq is anticipating a serious drought this summer following a particularly dry winter and reduced river flow caused by upstream damming programs by riparian countries. Climate change has potential impacts on food security such as reduction in wheat production, decrease in surface water storage, drying of shallower wells due to insufficient groundwater recharge, and an increase in the cost of water. If the dry conditions continue, and the water reservoirs are not replenished, the population will face an acute water shortage for irrigation of the next cropping season. ([UNICEF, UNV, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764326))     

In Iraq, large swathes of farmland, fisheries, power production and drinking water sources have been depleted of water. In the Ninewa governorate, wheat production is expected to go down by 70 per cent because of the drought, while in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq production is expected to decrease by half. Some families in Anbar who have no access to river water are spending up to USD80 a month on water.  ([ACTED, et. al., 23 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3767342))


Temperatures are hitting record highs; last year saw Baghdad’s highest temperature ever of 52 degrees Celsius. WFP’s assessments revealed that the 2021 rainfall season has been below average, particularly in the northern governorates and Kurdistan Region. This could impact the final yield of the two major crops; wheat and barley. WFP’s May surveys noted that 8 percent of people in Ninewa and Kirkuk governorates have insufficient food consumption, twice as many as the 4 percent national average. Similarly, 13.4 percent of people in Ninewa reported employing negative coping strategies – such as borrowing money or eating less food – above the 7.5 percent national average. WFP continues to monitor the situation closely, particularly the impact on food security. ([WFP, 6 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3771467))

As consistently reported by UN Iraq, drought and water scarcity are pressing concerns, and the marshlands of southern Iraq are among the worst affected areas. With annual evaporation varying from 2.5 to 3 meters, and starkly reduced riverine flows supplying the marshlands, the area covered by water has been substantially reduced. Moreover, increased salinity and mineral concentration directly impact human and animal health. Urgent action is required to address the lack of potable water and associated risks, including forced displacement.

Malaysia: Floods - Aug 2021,"Yan, Kedah was faced with a flash flood from the foothill of Mount Jerai (Gunung Jerai). The flash flood happened on Wednesday, 18 August 2021 at 5.30 pm (Local Malaysian Time). The heavy downpour caused water surges and landslides on Gunung Jerai that later hit Yan, Kuala Muda, and Bandar Baharu district in Kedah with muddy flash floods. The surrounding location of Gunung Jerai Resort was severely damaged. Difficulty in road access from the affected flash flood sites hampered the search and rescue of the casualties believed to have drowned and been swept away by the strong current. The flash floods have affected approximately 879 families (4,395 people) in the affected area of Yan district and 86 families (430 people) in Kubang Pasu district. The data collected is based on the district office in Yan and Kuala Muda as of 22 August 2021.

The Government opened two evacuation centres and hosted 43 people for short-term assistance. Currently, the evacuation centres had been closed. Out of 4,825 people affected by the flash flood, only 43 people went to the evacuation centres. People from the affected flash flood villages were hesitant to evacuate to the centres due to the fear of COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 cases in the Yan district are considered high at the state level. For Yan district, 395 positive COVID-19 cases have been reported, and in Kuala Muda district, figures have reached 6,285 cases. Carrying sediment and large tree trunks, the flash floods impacted nearby houses in the Kampung Pematang Keramat. Most of the houses in this village are 2 km from the primary impact area of the foothill of Gunung Jerai. The affected houses are covered in mud, some with minor damage.

Villages affected by the flash flood were covered with mud and sand on the houses since 18 August 2021. Of the three affected locations, the Yan district is the most affected location. Heavy rains poured a massive volume of water down a stream from Gunung Jerai, sweeping tree trunks and rocks through two km of the surrounding area. The ensuing floods destroyed local village livestock and vegetable farms. Local authorities have confirmed six deaths.

In Kuala Muda district, most areas were covered with muddy water, tree trunks, and large rocks from the side of the river. Despite mud covering houses, flood victims did not report heavy damage. People did, however, report damage to several home appliances and furniture. The walls of a few residences are damaged, smashed by rocks from the nearby river. Most of the houses are built with concrete structures and wood materials.

A river overflowed in Banda Baharu district, as heavy downpour caused pressure on a dam, flooded its water capacity and impacted poor drainage systems. Houses in this district were covered with muddy water with 25 people affected, and local authorities are providing assistance to this district.

In the two districts of Yan and Kuala Muda, flash floods destroyed farmland and plantations. Livestock loss such as chickens, goats, and cows was also reported, which are critical livelihood or safety net assets for the affected. Some farmers reportedly lost harvests due to the flood, which is significant as the rice harvest is due later this month. Kedah state is currently experiencing the third wave of COVID-19, with cases escalating in the last two weeks, reaching 1,538 new cases per day and 24,306 active cases. Kedah state is the seventh highest state with COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, reporting 89,027 cases as of 26 August 2021. In Malaysia, a Movement Control Order (MCO) is still ongoing, and the country has a COVID-19 recovery plan with different phases. Currently, Kedah state still falls under the category of phase 1, where daily cases are still high. ([IFRC, 30 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3769568/))

Haiti: Earthquake - Aug 2021,"On Saturday, 14 August a major 7.2-magnitude earthquake hit Haiti. According to Haiti’s Office for Civil Protection, 227 have died and the figure is sadly expected to increase in the coming hours. Preliminary reports by Haitian Red Cross volunteers and IFRC staff on the ground confirm that the earthquake has caused severe damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, especially in Jérémie and Les Cayes, at the Northern coast of the Southern peninsula of the country. Hospitals and hotels, as well as ports, bridges and routes are reported to have been damaged in Les Cayes and Jérémie, where churches collapsed while the morning mass was being celebrated. Search and rescue activities are concentrated in that area as there may be people trapped in the rubble. ([IFRC, 14 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3774047))

While preliminary assessments are still in their very early stages, the Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate (DGPC) reports more than 700 collapsed buildings, including hospitals, schools and churches, and 2,410 destroyed homes in the department of Nippes and 1,368 in Grand’Anse, forcing at least 470 people to seek refuge in shelters, with thousands more thought to be displaced. DGPC also reports at least 304 dead and around 1,800 more injured, figures likely to increase significantly in the coming hours and days as more are still missing. ([OCHA, 15 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3765093))

[...]1,400 people are dead and more than 6,900 others injured, while hundreds more are still missing. According to Haitian Civil Protection, more than 37,300 homes have been destroyed and 46,000 have sustained damages, leaving thousands homeless and creating pressing shelter and WASH needs. [...] The Government and high-ranking UN officials negotiated humanitarian access for a relief convoy to pass through the main road linking the capital Port-au-Prince to the country’s southern peninsula which, up to now, had been blocked by gangs for months, with further convoys set to deliver various supplies.([OCHA, 16 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3765493))

At least 52,000 houses have been destroyed and more than 77,000 damaged. On 16 August, DG ECHO mobilised €3 million in emergency humanitarian funding to address the most urgent needs of the affected population. On 16 August, the Government of Haiti sent a request for international assistance to the EU Delegation in Port-au-Prince. France, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden have already offered in-kind assistance via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. An EU Civil Protection Team was deployed to support the national authorities and coordinate the incoming EU assistance. The mission will be supported by a Technical Assistance and Support Team from the Swedish Civil Protection (MSB). ([ECHO, 20 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3766920))

More than two weeks after the devastating 14 August earthquake, humanitarian assistance is now beginning to reach those most in need faster, facilitated by enhanced Government-led coordination and robust efforts to negotiate increased humanitarian access into hard-to reach areas. [...] The combined impact of the earthquake and Tropical Depression Grace have left 650,000 thousand people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance, of which 500,000 are being targeted by UN agencies and humanitarian partners through the activities planned under the recently launched $187.3 million Flash Appeal. Based on an initial impact assessment, the Government estimates that damages from the powerful 7.2-magnitude quake exceed US$1 billion, as national authorities plan a more detailed assessment of damages, losses and post-earthquake needs in collaboration with the tripartite partnership comprised of the UN, the European Union and the World Bank as well as the Inter-American Development Bank.

More than three weeks after a devastating earthquake hit south-western Haiti, search- and-rescue efforts in the hardest-hit areas have been concluded as of 2 September, with efforts now shifting toward recovery operations as the country looks to pull itself out of yet another crisis. As of 4 September, search-and-rescue crews had extracted dozens of missing people from the rubble, including 16 trapped in a building in Les Cayes and 24 evacuated from Pic Macaya. The conclusive report from the Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate (DGPC) indicates that 329 people are still missing, while 2,248 were killed - including in the Nord- Ouest Department where 2 people died in Bassin Bleu - and 12,763 injured following the powerful 7.2-magnitude quake on 14 August.  ([OCHA, 7 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3771921))

[One month after the earthquake], the speed and efficiency of humanitarian relief operations continue to improve. However, as the Government and partners slowly transition to a recovery and reconstruction phase in many of the affected areas, coordinated efforts to get humanitarian assistance to those most in need continue to be hindered by a deteriorating security situation, restricted humanitarian access and limited communication with hard-to-reach communities, especially in rural areas which were most affected by the earthquake. The conclusive report from the Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate (DGPC) found that rural areas have been much harder hit than urban centres. [...] Despite coordinated efforts by humanitarian partners, many families in the most remote hard-to-reach villages have not received assistance, due in part to persistent access and at times security challenges, as many remote areas are only accessible by motorcycle, on foot, by air or sea. ([OCHA, 14 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/37740471))

The powerful 7.2-magnitude earthquake which stuck south-western Haiti on 14 August affected at least 800,000 people, including 340,000 children, and resulted in the death of more than 2,240 people. According to the Haitian General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) and IOM, as of 20 September, an estimated 38,777 displaced people have been identified in 89 displacement locations across the three most affected departments – Grand’Anse, Nippes and Sud – with more than half of these people located in 44 locations in the Sud Department. For the more than 12,700 injured people, access to adequate healthcare remains a challenge, as the quake damaged or destroyed approximately 90 health centres, with 60 per cent of affected people stating that health services close to them have been interrupted, according to UNICEF’s U-Report survey. The rollout of the new school year has been severely hindered by the earthquake’s multifaceted impacts, with more than 900 schools – around 70 per cent of all schools in south-western Haiti – damaged or destroyed. The majority of schools have been unable to reopen their doors to students just as 300,000 children were set to gradually resume classes in the three quake-affected departments on 4 October. UNICEF estimates that if classrooms remain closed, following a one-month delay in school reopening in affected departments, more than 230,000 children are at risk of dropping out of school. The earthquake has triggered a spike in international migration from Haiti, compounding the existing migration crisis of Haitians in the Americas, with increasing numbers of Haitian nationals arriving on the shores of neighbouring countries.

Two months after the devastating earthquake, humanitarian assistance had begun to reach those most in need faster, facilitated by enhanced Government-led coordination and efforts to negotiate increased humanitarian access into hard-to reach areas. As the operation is transitioning from immediate response to recovery and reconstruction, critical needs continue to exist. The affected population requires lifesaving assistance, with additional donor support needed to expand the reach of the humanitarian aid and kick-start recovery and reconstruction, with early recovery and restoration of livelihoods being a priority particularly in hard-to-reach communities. However, the operation continues to run under the constraints of a volatile security environment, with a high number of daily kidnappings, roadblocks and fuel shortages, resulting in the temporary slowdown of activities on a regular basis. As such, all programs are developing detailed workplans that can be adapted to different scenarios and respond more efficiently to changes in the operating environment. ([IFRC, 29 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3787315))

From 14 August to 1 December, over 300,185 people received emergency assistance, with 4,032 mt of food and USD 2.4 million in cash-based transfers distributed. Fuel scarcity and insecurity increased starting mid-October. A truce from mid-November saw fuel distribution slowly resume throughout the country. WFP received and responded to a significant number of fuel requests from partners prioritizing medical emergencies and life-saving activities. Road access to the areas impacted by the earthquake was restricted and truck convoys from Port-au-Prince to the south were suspended as of mid-October. WFP continued its barge service from Port-au-Prince to the commune of Carrefour in the suburban area of the capital to transport humanitarian assistance to the south. Since the earthquake, over 130 voyages have been organised. Despite these delays and challenges, distributions by WFP and partners continued.  ([WFP, 16 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803835))

Access to basic healthcare, nutrition, and safe water, sanitation, and hygiene services remains critical with important needs after the devastating earthquake that hit southwestern Haiti on 14 August. According to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), total damages and loss are estimated at US$ 1.62 billion, while recovery needs at US$ 1.98 billion.  Relief efforts have been severely hampered by a shortage of fuel throughout the country, while the humanitarian corridor has been interrupted due to increased gangs’ violence and insecurity. UNICEF water trucking facilitated access to water for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene for approximately 419,000 persons (69,000 in the reporting period). The construction of 75 blocks of latrines for the sites hosting the displaced people is ongoing, in respect of accessibility standards for people with disabilities.

Five months after a 7.2-magnitude quake severely affected the departments of Sud, Nippes and Grand'Anse on 14 August 2021, back-to-back aftershocks of magnitude 5.45 at 8:20 a.m. and 5.6 at 9:06 a.m. occurred on the morning of 24 January. These consecutive quakes lead to the death of two people and the injury of 52 others, destroying homes and triggering widespread panic, particularly among the school-age population, according to the DGPC. ([OCHA, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811087))

Multiples tremors and heavy rainfall occurred after the earthquake. During late January and early February 2022, heavy rainfalls hit several departments of the country notably the North, the Northeast and the Nippes departments. This situation is caused by the cold front extending from the North Atlantic to Nicaragua and crossing the island of Haiti. According to Directorate General of Civil Protection (DGPC), at least 20 municipalities were affected by floods caused by the waters of runoff and floods from some rivers. Consequently, 2,578 houses flooded and 3 destroyed, leaving nearly 10,750 people (2,500 families) in need of temporary shelter (disaster families) as well as food, NFIs, and drinking water. Furthermore, damage to road infrastructure has hampered humanitarian access. Through the revised emergency appeal, the IFRC in coordination with the HRCS has increased the original target of 25,000 people (5,000 households) to now aim to reach 35,000 people (7,000 households) in Sud, Nippes and Grand’ Anse departments. ([IFRC, 1 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3853156))

One year after a devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck southwestern Haiti, and three weeks before the beginning of a new academic year, more than 250,000 children do not have access to adequate schools, UNICEF warned.
Reconstruction, which has been delayed by insecurity and lack of funds, is still underway and may take years to complete. Of the 1,250 schools that were destroyed or damaged by the earthquake, the majority still have not been rebuilt. ([UNICEF, 16 Aug 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3877746))

As of 9 December 2022, the total area affected covers 500 square kilometres and over 800,000 people have been directly affected. Of 159 health facilities assessed, 28 have been severely damaged and 60 more have been damaged, with 456 schools impacted and 64 destroyed. Total economic damage and losses are estimated at USD 1.6 billion, or about 10 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). ([IFRC, 9 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3915097))

In the southern departments, which were particularly affected by the August 2021 earthquake, some 2,528 people are still displaced as a result of the earthquake. [...] . In the southern departments, efforts to rebuild the 1,250 schools destroyed in the 14 August 2021 earthquake were hampered by logistical difficulties related to gang activity and the fuel crisis. Approximately 300,000 children were left in environments not conducive to learning.

Algeria: Wild Fires - Aug 2021,"Wildfires have been affecting the Kabylia Region in northern Algeria since 9 August. More than 70 fires have occurred in 13 prefectures in the north of the country including Tizi-Ouzou, Bouira, Sétif, Khenchela, Guelma, Bejaïa, Bordj Bou Arreridj, Boumerdès, Tiaret, Medea, Tébessa, Blida and Skikda. According to media reports, more than 40 people have died as a result of the fires. The Algerian government has requested assistance from the international community in response to the fires, including through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism on 11 August for two Canadair aircraft to respond to fires in the Tizi Ouzou and Bejaïa regions. According to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), the fire risk will remain high to very extreme over the affected area. ([ECHO, 11 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3763991))    

Fires raged in north and north-east of Algeria overnight on Monday 9 August 2021, and throughout Tuesday 10 August 2021, killing at least 69 people including 28 members of the People's National Army deployed as firefighters, rescuing over 100 people in Bejaia and Tizi-Ouzou. The governorates of Tizi-Ouzou, Bouira, Sétif, Khenchela, Guelma, Bejaia, Bordj Bou Arreridj, Boumerdes, Tiaret, Medea, Tebessa, Annaba, Souk Ahras, Ain Defla, Jijel, Batna, Blida and Skikda were affected by the fires. Algeria’s National Meteorology Office forecasted extremely hot weather through 12 August in nearly a dozen wilayas (governorates), including Tizi-Ouzou. The temperature was expected to reach 47 degrees Celsius in those wilayas, which are already suffering from severe water shortages. The Algerian Government mobilized the People’s National Army, dispatched 12 fire engines, and mobilized more than 900 firefighters to put out the fires and protect people and property. ([IFRC, 18 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3766980))

On 25 October, the Algerian government launched a national tree planting campaign for 19 million trees across the affected governorate by the fires, in addition the government launched an online platform for rehabilitation of forests affected by the recent fires in order to enable citizens and civil society organizations to participate and volunteer in this program. To date, there is a need to provide safe drinking water and sanitation to the populations in the proposed shelters as part of the essential preventive health actions to avoid outbreaks. Hygiene supplies must be provided to the
families in order to maintain proper hygiene conditions in the shelter sites. Due to the increased risk of heatstroke or heat exhaustion during extended exposure to high temperatures, heatwaves also pose a hazard to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses. These health risks may also extend to relatively healthy individuals during significant heatwave events.

Tuvalu: Drought - Aug 2021,"Tuvalu is highly reliant on rainfall as the main source of fresh water. There are no rivers on the islands and groundwater is extremely limited ... Rainfall for the last three months in Tuvalu has been at the lowest 25 per cent in historical record, causing the regional Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) Early Action Rainfall (EAR) Watch to place Tuvalu at ‘dry warning’ level. Despite the national EAR Watch’s climate outlook forecasting normal rainfall for the coming months, the likelihood of Tuvalu proceeding to serious or severely dry conditions remains high. Preparedness and early actions are advisable given past and future seasonal data. Tuvalu relies almost solely on rainwater for consumption, indicating that continued monitoring and data collection would be of high value, as the situation can deteriorate rapidly. 

Tuvalu National Drought Committee (DC) was activated on 5 July, and agreed to meet weekly to provide updates on both thresholds (rainfall received and government water reserves). The Ministry of Public Works established seven water distribution points which have been operational since 12 July on Funafuti, where all households are able to collect six buckets of water (approximately 60 liters per household per day) ... Worthy to note, the 2011 drought resulted in widespread sickness due to a decrease in handwashing, low household water reserves that increased pathogen concentrations, and a switch to untreated or less hygienic water sources. As Tuvalu is in its dry season till October, there is an impressed need to consider the early actions that may be required, and the data needed to implement those early actions, in support of the most affected islands that may face water challenges.

North Macedonia: Wild Fires - Jul 2021,"Starting from 30 July 2021, the Republic of North Macedonia was hit by a heat wave that resulted in severe fires in several regions in the country. The fires have been raging for 16 days and are still not under control despite the enormous efforts of the state institutions responsible for crisis management as well as the local population. According to forecasts, the extremely hot weather is expected to continue until 25 August.

The hot weather and high temperatures resulted in intensive recurring fires in many regions in the country in the last 12 days. The severe fires in numerous regions resulted in devastation of forests, fertile land, crops and property of the population. One casualty and several injured persons (inhaling smoke) have been reported. Numerous houses as well as other facilities have burnt down and were damaged in many villages.

On 4 August 2021, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia declared a state of crisis on the whole territory of the country for a period of 30 days. This is the trigger date for this DREF operation. There are still active fires in 3 locations as of 18 August. The situation cannot be predicted and may develop in different directions. The declared emergency situation in the country is currently until 30 August, with a possibility to be prolonged.

The most affected regions are as follows: Strumica, Kochani, Kumanovo, Gevgelija, Valandovo, Bitola and Prilep, Shtip, Berovo, Pehchevo, Delchevo Skopje, Radovish, Ohrid, Kriva Palanka, Veles.

The crisis management system of the country is coordinating efforts to put out the fires and to assist the affected population. Response teams from the Fire Brigade, the Crisis Management Centre, the Directorate for Protection and Rescue, the Army, and the Red Cross of the Republic of North Macedonia are coordinating efforts in the field in order to cope and respond to the crisis situation. However, due to the limited resources of the state for dealing with fires (no air tractors and only two army helicopters available for firefighting), an expansion of wildfires was observed almost on the whole territory of the country.

The Red Cross of the Republic of North Macedonia (RCRNM) with all material and human resources, in frames of its possibilities, is participating in the overall efforts of the state authorities to respond to the crisis situation. The overall Red Cross operation is coordinated by the RCRNM Operational Centre which is responsible for coordination of the activities of the national society with the state authorities and the Red Cross branches. The Head of the RCRNM Operational Centre participates on a daily basis in the coordination meetings of the Centre for Crisis Management in order to coordinate the work of the National Society with the state agencies working in the field on national and local level.

The weather forecast for the forthcoming days is extreme high temperatures with +40°C, which means that the situation with the raging fires would continue during the whole month of August.

Kazakhstan: Drought - Jul 2021,"In the Republic of Kazakhstan, the heatwave that began in June 2021 in the Southern and Western regions of the country (Kyzylorda, Mangystau and Turkestan provinces) led to record temperatures up to 46.5℃ (recorded on 7 July) in the area with a baseline average of 28.3℃. 

This has seriously affected the main livestock farms. According to the local meteorological service ""Kazhydromet"", the influx of hot and dry air masses from the region of Iran preserves abnormally hot weather on the territory of most of the Republic of Kazakhstan. According to the data provided by the Global Drought Observatory (GDO), a high risk of drought and arid conditions are observed in several regions of the country (Mangystau, Turkestan, Kyzylorda).

As a result of the abnormally high air temperature in various country regions, rapid runoff of rivers and reservoirs occurs.  As a result, the soil dries up to a depth of 50 cm, which causes a lack of vegetation and natural feed on pastures. Due to the impossibility of grazing livestock, the minimum reserves of feed and water are exhausted, which leads to the mass death of animals. To date, the end of more than 2,000 units of livestock has been recorded in the target regions, and this figure is increasing every day. In addition, crops are also being destroyed by the heat, which can potentially2 lead to a major food crisis in several regions of the country, where cattle are a key object of vital activity due to the geographical and climatic features of the southern and western parts of Kazakhstan. The death of livestock and crops in the three regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Mangistau, Kyzylorda and Turkestan regions, see Picture 2) causes severe damage to the local population since animal husbandry is the only source of income and constitutes a vital activity.

In addition, more than 1,400 people in several wards in Myawaddy Town in Kayin State were evacuated to 10 relief camps on 26 July[...] Additional people, whose exact number could not be ascertained, have also been affected in several townships in Mon State, including in Mawlamyine and Ye.

In Rakhine, initial reports indicated that Kalar Chaung Monastery displacement site, hosting about 1,000 [IDPs] in Mrauk-U Township has been flooded on 25 July. This has affected approximately 24 out of 142 shelters within the displacement site. In Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung townships, over 600 households in several villages have been affected, while roads connecting communities have been blocked and power supply disrupted in Thandwe Township since 26 July; water levels on the roads have reached up to nine feet. Some 200 households in the township’s affected areas have been evacuated to safer locations by local volunteers; they are expected to return to their places of origin soon. In Kyaukpyu Township, Kyauk Ta Lone IDP camp, at least 27 families have had their temporary shelter damaged, and dozens of sanitation facilities damaged or destroyed due to the floods. The affected people are taking refuge in the higher sections of the camp, hosted by relatives.

Operational partners are currently collaborating with local aid groups and volunteers to better understand the situation and collect information on people’s needs. According to multiple sources, many people in affected locations and other areas where precipitation had been forecasted need support with evacuation. Those who have been evacuated or otherwise affected by floods require assistance in food, emergency shelter, health care and medical supplies, according to initial reports. Local volunteers have managed to evacuate the affected people and have provided initial assistance in terms of food and WASH as well as some COVID-19 awareness raising activities. The response, however, is likely to be impacted by access limitations, including those related to the current COVID-19 prevention measures. ([OCHA, 30 Jul 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3760705/))

Some 380,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the river Nile, Sudd wetlands and the rivers Lol and Sobat since May. **Jonglei** and **Unity** states are the worst affected. Early seasonal rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements across the top of the country, with more heavy rains and flooding expected in the coming months. Many of the flood-affected people moved to higher grounds within their county, and plan to return home once the flood waters recede. Some 100,000 people, mostly from **Twic East**, who were displaced by the 2020 floods, still have not returned home and are sheltering in the Bor and Mangalla IDP camps, and in Mingkaman, according to humanitarian partners.

The country has faced floods for three consecutive years and the current flooding has worsened the already dire situation, and people have no food and no land to cultivate. Fields are submerged by floodwater and higher grounds are overcrowded with makeshift structures. People have been forced to leave their flooded houses to higher grounds, makeshift shelters and host families. The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don’t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021. ([IFRC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811293))

Most communities affected depend on farming for survival and the flooding has made it hard to practice subsistence farming worsening food insecurity and the start of long rains in April 2022 worsening the dire situation. The impacts are especially harsh in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile state, where thousands of people have been displaced or marooned in dike-ringed compounds, holding back floodwaters with mud, sticks, and plastic sheeting. In a prediction to Uganda, ICPAK has predicted heavy rainfall (greater than 100mm) over South Sudan for the period 24 – 31st May 2022 as the UN projects the impacts from floods will be even dire in South Sudan by the time the rainy season ends.

Most affected states are Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity and Western Equatoria but also Jonglei and Upper Nile currently affected by conflicts and a difficult access. The floods will further drive food insecurity as 16.5kha cropland is potentially affected. Homes, schools and health facilities have been destroyed. Roads and bridges washed away hampering humanitarians to reach affected people. Boreholes and latrines submerged thereby contaminating water sources and risking outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Priority needs include food assistance, shelter, health, nutrition and WASH supplies. Contingency stocks in WASH and Shelter-Non Food Items pipelines have been considerably depleted. Flood response preparedness plans were implemented and response is ongoing, including through the EU-funded Emergency/Rapid Response Mechanisms.

Gambia: Windstorm - Jul 2021,"Starting on 2nd July 2021, The Gambia has been experiencing a windstorm surge which has, as of 12 July, affected over 16,849 people in more than 100 communities across all seven regions of the country. The situation, which is still unfolding, has caused internal displacement and homelessness. Indeed, over 100 severely injured people have been recorded as a result of fallen walls and trees. On 8 July, the Head of State summoned an emergency meeting while the windstorm was still ongoing, requesting for support from all well-wishers for the affected communities.

As the storm continues, ten deaths have been confirmed as a result of collapsed buildings. According to the Meteorological Department, on 7 July, the windspeed was at 85 km per hour and was the first of its kind to be recorded in the last five years. The unfolding disaster has already caused considerable damage on the lives and livelihoods of the people. Many affected people have “no place to live and nothing to eat” said the Executive Director of National Disaster Management Agency (NMDA) at a press briefing at their head office in Kanifing on 8 July 2021 at 3:00pm, attended by the Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS) Secretary General and essential staff.

The GRCS, the NDMA and other partners immediately launched a joint rapid assessment which is still ongoing. Preliminary information as of 12 July 2021 from an assessment indicates that more than 16,849 people (approximately 1,057 households) are affected, including more than 1,531 internally displaced persons (IDPs), among whom many are currently being sheltered by relatives and host families. Preliminary information reports the destruction of several houses, schools and health centres and community seed storage facilities in some of the affected villages. However, in the process of developing the Emergency Plan of Action many more reports are indicating a sharp increase in the number of affected people and households throughout the country.

The GRCS has consequently deployed rapid assessment teams to the affected areas/regions. The National Society (NS) is conducting initial distribution of household items to the most vulnerable and dignity packs alongside the assessment exercise.

The Gambia has a sub-tropical climate with sunshine throughout the year with average temperatures between 29°C and 34°C. The rainy season runs from June to September and sometimes beyond. The country has experienced over the past few years extensive downpours causing severe destruction as a result of poor draining systems, afforestation, felling of trees for new settlements (new estate developers) etc., causing floods, destruction and untold suffering. The rainy/farming season has just begun with forecasts indicating intermitted heavy rainfall accompanied by severe windstorms. These imminent precipitations may further complicate the situation and severe consequences on the rural population in particular are expected.

Iran: Drought - Jul 2021,"The Iranian climate is mostly arid or semi-arid and it is heavily affected by depleting water resources, as a result of rising demand, salinization, groundwaters overexploitation, and increasing drought frequency. The country, where groundwater is the primary source of water, has a long history of inefficiency in its water distribution network, particularly in the agricultural sector. Despite not experiencing food insecurity, Iran faces paramount challenges in safeguarding long-term water access during the dry spell. All sectors that rely on the water are exposed, from agriculture to power production and public water supply. Currently, from 2 to 20 million people are at high to medium risk of drought-related impacts. On top of poor precipitation during the 2020-2021 winter, high temperatures have caused more snow to melt, reducing the amount of water stored for later use during the drier months (i.e., late spring and summer). ([IFRC, 5 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3762302))

The IRCS estimates that 4.8 million people are at medium to high risk of drought-related impacts, mostly in remote and rural areas of the provinces. The Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) reports that 29 of 31 provinces, and especially seven – South Khorasan, Kerman, Sistan Balochistan, Hormozgan, Khuzestan, Isfahan, Khorasan Razavi – have been severely affected by the drought ... The drought has brought widespread reliance on water trucking and bottled water for drinking. Many individuals or households have moved from rural to urban areas, resulting in the abandonment of villages in rural areas and the worsening of living conditions in urban areas. The IRCS reports the drought has exacerbated the existing vulnerabilities and social marginalization of women. Drought places additional burdens on women in terms of their responsibilities around household care. Moreover, the migration of predominantly young men distorts the gender balance in the urban centres. Children are particularly vulnerable, with increased risks to their health, such as skin and eye diseases, cognitive development, in addition to respiratory problems associated with the drought.

The monsoon rains that began in the last week of June have triggered flooding and landslides in many parts of the country, affecting around 10,000 families in 56 out of the country’s 77 districts. [...] On 26 August, rainfall intensified for at least four consecutive days, with many rivers crossing warning levels, causing widespread inundation in many parts of the southern plains and reported incidents of landslides in the hilly region. As a result of this incessant rainfall, 11 districts (Myagdi, Rupandehi, Dang, Darchula, Sindhuli, Nawalparasi East, Nawalparasi West, Kanchanpur, Kailali, Udayapur and Mahottari) and 4,899 families were affected, including 2,129 who were temporarily displaced. In addition, government authorities have reported seven deaths and one missing person in recent days (as of 31 August 2021), while further assessment processes are underway. [...] Many houses have been destroyed by the landslides and floods in specific pocket areas of several districts, and many displaced families are staying with relatives, while others have sought refuge in nearby schools and other temporary shelters. Similarly, displaced families have lost access to water points and sanitation facilities, increasing the risk of health problems, water-borne diseases, and the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community. [...] With 35,591 active cases in the country, there is a high chance of COVID-19 transmission among people affected by the flood and landslide (daily infection rate is still around 20 per cent) either among those staying in home isolation or – most importantly – among those staying in evacuation centres.

Syria: Drought - 2021-2024,"Since autumn 2020, unseasonably low levels of rainfall across the eastern region of the Mediterranean Basin, have contributed to drought conditions in Syria and Iraq. Given the country's semi-arid climate, the annual water balance is determined by precipitation patterns between October and April and pronounced seasonal rainfall, with deficits accumulated enduring for the remainder of the year. In Syria, poor precipitation during the 2020/2021 winter season, as well as the months critical for crop development (January-April), have negatively impacted several governorates in the northeast, with Al-Hasakeh – typically the breadbasket of the country – particularly badly affected ... Syria currently ranks seventh on a global risk index of 191 countries most at risk of a humanitarian or natural disaster event that could overwhelm response capacity, in part due to the ongoing crisis which hinders adequate preparedness measures. With temperatures in the Mediterranean basin predicted to increase in the coming years, and water scarcity expected to persist, extreme climatic events such as drought are likely to become more frequent and intense. Of the nine countries rated as ‘very high risk’, Syria is the third highest at risk of drought. ([OCHA, 27 Jun 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3751300))

Since April/May 2021, the humanitarian situation in northeastern Aleppo as well as Deir-ez-Zor, Al-Hasakeh and Ar-Raqqa Governorates has deteriorated further due to significantly reduced water availability and access, as a result of the following climatic and man-made factors[...]The overall deterioration in people’s living standards is aggravating multiple, pre-existing protection needs and risks, threatening social cohesion and encouraging more widespread adoption of harmful coping mechanisms, including amongst an estimated 289,000 IDPs (internally displaced people) living in ‘last resort sites’ in NES.

The number of people that are food insecure and in acute need of humanitarian assistance increased by 400,000 during the first half of 2021 bringing the total number to 12.8 million people, an increase of more than 60% compared to 2021. According to the FAO, Syrian farmers face challenges preparing for the upcoming planting season due to lack of liquidity and access to credit, while prices of inputs such as fertilizers and fuel are increasing. Furthermore, access to seeds will likely be difficult and seed quality poor with low germination rates due to the drastically reduced 2020/2021 harvest. This impacts in particular small-scale farmers that lack alternative livelihoods income sources and continue to cultivate their lands. ([IFRC, 20 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3784486))

Already weakened by 10 years of conflict, the economy suffered further setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic and spill-over effects from the economic crisis in Lebanon, long a lifeline of the Syrian economy. High inflation rates, weakening currency and shortages of basic products, including fuel, prevail. International sanctions have generally affected livelihoods of millions of Syrians, directly or indirectly. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), more than 12.4 million people (60 percent of the population) were food insecure in 2020, 5.4 million more than in 2019. The food security situation has continued to worsen in 2021. Insufficient and poorly distributed rainfall in the 2020/21 agricultural season, together with several heatwaves, the high cost of inputs, limited availability of irrigation water and high cost of fuel for pumping, resulted in a contraction of the harvestable cereal area. ([FAO, 17 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3801870))

The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) seasonal outlook for Syria indicates that a severe and long-term drought is affecting Syria. Water deficits have been exacerbated by unusual dry conditions during the wet season, but also by abnormally high air temperatures, which are forecast to continue into the July–September hot and dry season. The multi-year drought and the scarcity and high cost of water, food, and energy are mutually reinforcing and are underpinning Syria’s food security crisis. Humanitarian partners are working to update the water response plan of September 2021. ([ECHO, 18 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3867139))

Severe drought is reported in many regions after successive months of failed rainfall. During the wet period11 from October 2021 to May 2022, only March recorded normal to above-normal precipitation. Water deficits have been exacerbated due to drier than average conditions in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 wet seasons, but also by increasing evaporative demand associated with above-normal air temperatures during the July-September hot and dry season. According to Vegetation Health Index (VHI) products, the vegetation conditions have deteriorated since April 2022 and there was an intensification of drought in most of Syria. The situation in the first week of October 2022 was worse than during the same period of 2021 and VHI high-risk drought classes three and four prevail in large areas of the country.  [...] The outlook for the November 2022-January 2023 period suggests an increased probability of below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures. While forecast uncertainty increases with lead time, i.e. the length of time between the issuance of forecasts and the occurrence of the predicted phenomena, there are consistent signals of below-average precipitation in winter 2022/23. ([OCHA, 22 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3918702))

After more than ten years of conflict in Syria, access to water has become one of the most prominent humanitarian challenges, which is exacerbated by climate change. According to SARC's severity scale updated in June 2023, all ofAl-Sweida's districts are ranked at levels 3 to 5, meaning they are facing a major, severe, or critical problem in water  needs. The Al-Sweida governorate faced during this period a sharp decline in water availability, the causes of which appear to be the intertwining of many factors: Loss of the main source of drinking water since 2012 which used to  provide 15,000 cubic meters of water daily (half the city's population needs), the increase of the population between 2010 and 2022 by 75% increasing the demand on water and pressure on resources, the decrease in the number of hours of electrical supply from 24 hours/day to 4 hours/day negatively affecting the pumps and water pumping, and the decrease in the maintenance and technical level of logistical operating equipment [...] Climate change has reduced pasture areas at an alarming pace due to the effects of high temperatures. Heat and lack of rain, in addition to the devastating impact of the long-term conflict in the region, made many pumping stations out of commission or insecure in terms of access thus out of service. The lack of management of vital natural resources may lead to an environmental disaster, perhaps the most prominent of which is the Cholera outbreak of 2022. In the past weeks, reports indicate an increase of hepatitis A cases in Al-Sweida, governorate, in light of emerging diseases linked to usage of unsafe water and food. The entire area of the governorate is threatened by water shortage, which is reflected in its impact on the entire population who rely mostly on rain-fed agriculture. The deterioration of this produce negatively affects the food security situation. Water shortage is also exacerbated by the decline in purchasing power and the increase in financial burdens as a result of the unavailability of drinking water.

Tropical Cyclone Yaas has formed over the Bay of Bengal from a deep depression and is moving towards the north-eastern coast of **India**. Yaas is predicted to make landfall over the Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal on 26 May with wind speeds of up to 185 km/h and potential storm surge of more than 3.5 meters along coastal areas of India and Bangladesh. Due to full moon and high tide, the height of the storm surge could increase by an additional one meter or more. Authorities in eastern India are evacuating at least one million people from low-lying areas and areas prone to storm surge and have mobilized rescue and relief teams. While the impact of Yaas is expected to be less severe in **Bangladesh**, authorities in the Barisal Division are preparing to evacuate about two million people. Disaster Management Committees in coastal districts are preparing cyclone shelters and are pre-positioning emergency supplies. Yaas comes only a week after Cyclone Tauktae battered the western coast of India as the first tropical storm this season. ([OCHA 25 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3741149))

Following the passage of Tropical cyclone YAAS that made landfall over the northern coast of Odisha on 26 May, the number of casualties has been increasing. According to media reports, in **India**, six people have died and approximately 22,000 houses have been damaged across the States of Odisha and West Bengal. In addition, airports in Kolkata and Bhubaneshwar have been temporarily closed and train services were cancelled. In **Bangladesh**, 15,000 people have been displaced across 200 villages as their homes, shops and farms have been flooded. ([ECHO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742089))

As of 31 May, in **India**, an estimated 300,000 houses were destroyed or damaged as sea waters along the Bengal coast and rivers started swelling and breached embankments. In West Bengal, more than 4,600 villages were affected, and about 230,000 people are displaced across 14,000 relief camps. According to authorities in the neighboring state of Odisha, more than 128 villages have been severely affected across ten districts. In **Bangladesh**, tidal surge combined with the collapse of embankments flooded low-lying coastal areas in the districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bhola, Patuakhali and Borguna, leaving at least four people dead, displacing about 15,000 people across 200 villages, and damaging or destroying thousands of houses, farm land and fish enclosures.

DR Congo: Volcano Nyiragongo - May 2021,"On Saturday 22 May around 18.30 UTC, first news of an eruption of the Volcano Nyiragongo, situated in the north of the city of Goma in North Kivu province, started to appear on media websites. Effusive eruption was quickly confirmed, with reports of power cuts, people self-evacuating and crossing the border to Rwanda. The evacuation plan of the city of Goma was activated by the authorities very quickly. As of today (23/05), it seems that the situation has calmed down and people have been allowed to go back home even so, some seismic activities are still on-going and the potential threats caused by volcanic gas (SO2 and CO2) are not fully averted. A main road north of Goma (N2) has been cut by the lava flows and may have a significant impact on movements towards north. The extent of the damages are not yet known and are being assessed for the time-being. ([ECHO, 23 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3740717))

The number of earthquakes detected in the area of Nyiragongo volcano and the deformation rates have decreased slightly since 29 May 2021. However, seismic activity and ground deformation continue to indicate the presence of magma under the urban area of Goma with an extension under Lake Kivu. An estimated 415,700 people have been displaced across several localities in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and across the border in Rwanda. Authorities and humanitarian organisations are providing help for those most affected. The rehabilitation of the damaged water supply system in Goma is ongoing. The risk of a cholera outbreak remains. Twelve suspected cholera cases were reported in the health centre of Saké between 27 and 29 May. Saké hosts more than 56,000 displaced persons and most suspected cholera cases are among them. ([ECHO, 31 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742879))

The recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar. [(OCHA, 17 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3738815)

Between October 2020 and March 2021, the impact of La Niña caused below normal rainfall in drought prone areas of Balochistan (-63.3 per cent rainfall) and Sindh (-77.3 per cent). According to the National Drought Monitoring Centre (NDMC), moderate drought conditions are prevailing across 18 districts in the two provinces. An estimated 1.8 million people are expected to experience acute food insecurity and 530,000 people emergency levels of food insecurity from March to June 2021 in 12 of the 18 drought-affected districts, according to the Food Security Sector.

Around 2.3 million people (23 percent of the rural population analysed) are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and Phase 4 (Emergency) in the current period (October 2021-March 2022), corresponding to the planting/lean season. These include around 1.7 million people (17 percent of the rural population) in IPC Phase 3 and around 0.63 million people (6 percent of the rural population) in IPC Phase 4 across the nine districts analysed. All districts have at least 5 percent of their population in IPC Phase 4, and except for Badin and Dadu, the other seven districts have between 20-30 percent of their populations in IPC Phase 3 or 4. Urgent action is therefore required to protect
livelihoods and reduce food consumption gaps of people in Crisis and Emergency phases of acute food insecurity. Out of the nine analysed districts, seven districts, namely Jamshoro, Mirpur Khas, Sanghar, Sujawal, Tharparakar, Thatta and Umerkot are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), whereas Badin and Dadu are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed).

In April 2022, Light to Moderate rainfall was reported from most of most of the Upper parts of Pakistan including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Precipitation during April 2022 was below normal especially over most of the drought-prone areas of Sindh and Balochistan due to which some areas are still under moisture stress. Mild to Moderate Drought Conditions are prevailing over SW areas of Balochistan and Sindh. ([Govt. of Pakistan, 30 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3842787))

The country overall received below normal (-21.6%) rainfall from January to April 2022. Due to a good amount of rainfall during January, the previous drought conditions became normalized. Due to an abrupt increase in daily maximum temperature, heatwave situation was observed from mid of March to date and land surface temperature remained very high, which affected the low rainfall region i.e., Sindh, Balochistan, south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southern Punjab (Cholistan region). Keeping in view the impact of heatwave, the drought-like situation has emerged over most of the high-temperature regions of the country. Keeping in view the climatology and current seasonal forecast of PMD for these areas, drought conditions may exacerbate and affect the agriculture, water resources and live stocks till mid of June 2022 (before the arrival of the summer monsoon). Dry conditions may cause water stress in the cultivated lands/areas of the country due to the limited availability of irrigation water for Kharif crops.

On 1 June, Government of Timor-Leste, together with humanitarian partners, officially launched a joint appeal to address the residual humanitarian needs for the most vulnerable affected people and assist with early-recovery efforts in Timor-Leste. The appeal requests US$32.7 million (US $8.8m for immediate needs and US$23.9 for short-term requirements) that will directly assist 65,000 people and indirectly benefit all flood-affected population. The Government has allocated US$65.2 million through the Contingency Fund while the humanitarian partners including the United Nations, have so far committed US$10.7 million to support the response efforts.

Rice and maize production was severely affected by the floods, landslides and strong winds, which completely destroyed some rice fields. Manatuto
municipality was the most affected, particularly Laclo and Manatuto post-administratives. Irrigated agricultural land near rivers was washed away and irrigation infrastructures sustained extensive damages. A Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) assessment identified 90 *sucos* where such infrastructure was damaged, with infrastructure in Baucau municipality critically affected and that in Viqueque, Bobonaro, Aileu and RAEOA moderately damaged. If the damage remains unrepaired, 2 800 ha of rice will be left unirrigated or insufficiently irrigated, leading to losses of 60 percent of the yield worth USD 1.5 million annually. The floods have worsened the situation for marginal farming households who had already lost significant assets and income as a result of multiple shocks. Vulnerable households also lack mechanization and have limited access to inputs and markets, restricting their ability to recover. [(FAO, 16 Jun 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3747964/)

Bangladesh: Cox’s Bazar Camp Settlement Fire - Mar 2021,"On 22 March 2021, a massive fire swept through the camp settlement in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, destroying shelters and facilities and endangering lives across four camps. So far, 11 casualties have been reported, and 55,000 people have been displaced. According to data shared by the camp authority, a total of 563 people from the affected camps have been injured and 339 are missing. It is understood that there are approximately 10,000 damaged shelters...According to the Flash Update issued by the ISCG Secretariat, among the essential facilities impacted by the fire are the IOM primary healthcare clinic, MSF clinic, Turkish hospital and LPG distribution points. No BDRCS facility or infrastructure has been affected as a relatively small amount of programming is undertaken in the affected areas. While there has been a history of several fires in the camp settlement in past times including two incidents in January this year, the intensity and scale of this latest fire is unprecedented. Cramped conditions in the severely congested settlement are believed to have contributed to the quick escalation of the fire. [(IFRC, 27 Mar 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725186/)

A series of explosions on Sunday in Equatorial Guinea is now known to have killed 31 people, officials say. The number of those injured rose to 600. The blasts hit a military base in the country’s main city, Bata. Officials blame badly stored dynamite along with stubble burning by nearby farmers. Teams including volunteers continue to search the wreckage of buildings and homes for victims. There are fears the death toll could rise further as some victims may still be trapped. In a statement, President Obiang Nguema said the blasts had been caused “by the negligence of a unit charged with the care and protection of stores of dynamite and explosives” at the Nkoantoma military base. He said the base had “caught fire due to neighbouring farmers clearing farming land by setting it alight, leading to the explosion”. The president has appealed for international aid.

In both counties, cases are on the rise and urgent action needs to be taken to prevent an all-out outbreak which would endanger the lives of the population, causing a health disaster. Public health officials are warning that more cases should be expected as the seasonal ‘long rains’ run through to the end of May, boosting mosquito populations. Previous outbreak data and monthly trends show that annual upsurges are experienced after the short and long rainfall seasons with dual peaks in February and June. The usual trend is that the next peak would occur in June, after the long rains have subdued; however, in this case, the virus is surging at the beginning of the long rains, which will most likely make the situation worse as conditions become more conducive for the mass spread of the disease vector.

Power and water cut have been also reported in the District of Pichari.  ([ECHO, 23 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3732647))

The National Institute of Civil Defense (INDECI) reported that on June 29, as a result of the intense rainfall, there was an increase and subsequent overflow of the Shamboyacu River, which caused a flood in the Shamboyacu district located in the province of Picota (San Martín). The Regional Emergency Operations Center (COER) reported 30 affected homes and 17 habitable ones, as well as 71 affected families.

DR Congo: Ebola Outbreak - Feb 2021,"The Butembo branch of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) confirmed Ebola in samples taken from a patient with Ebola-like symptoms who had sought treatment at a local health centre. The woman was the wife of an Ebola survivor. She has since died. Butembo was one of the epicentres of the previous Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC. It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak. Due to the enormous local capacity built in the previous outbreak, the North Kivu Provincial health authorities are leading the current response with support from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO provided training to laboratory technicians, contact tracers, local vaccination teams and reached out to community groups to raise Ebola awareness as well as put in place an Ebola survivor programme. ([WHO, 7 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711107))

As of 4 March 2021, the situation is the following: 11 confirmed EVD cases, including 4 deaths, across 6 health areas in 4 health zones: Biena, Katwa, Butembo and Musienene; Two health workers among confirmed cases; 57% case fatality rate; 856 people vaccinated; only 36% of cases were among people who had been listed as contacts and benefited from vaccination, demonstrating critical gaps in surveillance; average time to have people isolated after first symptoms is five days.

Afghanistan: Drought - 2021-2024,"Afghanistan has been experiencing below-normal rainfall since October 2020. Such conditions are expected to continue through the first half of 2021 in the country according to forecasters. The conditions have affected the winter season snow accumulation, which is critical for water access during the spring and summer agricultural seasons. It is anticipated that the situation will have an impact on both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture/livestock, as well as on the availability of water for drinking, washing, and sanitation. Mid-March through to the end of July will likely be the peak period during which drought impacts on crops and livestock (agricultural drought) would manifest. The wheat production deficit is expected to be 16 to 27 per cent this year and as a result, requiring increased top-up from international suppliers. Such drivers would further affect communities already suffering from the ongoing economic crises exacerbated by the secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including high prices of basic commodities, conflict, and food insecurity. 

The ongoing food insecurity situation is very much worse than the previous years. According to the IPC report, from November 2019 to March 2020, 2,695,000 people were in IPC phase 4 and 8,591,000 people were in IPC phase 3. Based on the same IPC report (produced recently by Food Security Cluster and Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock), between November 2020 and March 2021 – a period that corresponds to the lean season –around 13.15 million people (42% of the total population) have been experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), out of which nearly 4.3 million people are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and an estimated 8.85 million people are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Moreover, only five provinces of the country were in IPC phase 4 in the first quarter of 2020, but by March 2021, 10 provinces of the country are classified in IPC phase 4. ([IFRC, 19 Mar 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3723898))

Nearly 11 million people in Afghanistan are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) due to conflict, COVID-19, high food prices and rampant unemployment, between March and May 2021 (the lean season in most parts of the country.) This includes around 7.8 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 3.2 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and require urgent action to save lives, reduce food gaps and save and protect livelihoods. Between June and November 2021 (harvest and post-harvest seasons), a slight improvement in food security is expected, with the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above decreasing to 9.5 million, with 6.7 million in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 2.7 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). The areas that were in Phase 4 in the current analysis period are expected to remain in Phase 4 in the projection period, despite slight seasonal improvements. It is likely that household’s food access will improve slightly with the onset of the harvest, better job opportunities, as well as seasonal decreases in prices; however, rainfall forecasts suggest that the harvest will be below average, which will likely affect food availability during the following lean season. The food security situation has relatively improved compared to the last three years, aside from the impacts of drought in 2018 and the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. However, the food security situation is still concerning and expected to deteriorate further during the 2021-2022 lean season. ([IPC, 22 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3732293))

As per a multi-sectoral needs’ analysis conducted by the Inter Cluster Country Team (ICCT), 25 provinces are estimated to be highly impacted by drought, although the drought has not yet been officially declared by the government of Afghanistan. The impact of the climatic events, storm-related flooding, conflict, and COVID-19 will vary across regions based on the degree to which these phenomena manifest and interact with pre-existing vulnerabilities in various locations The drought will likely result in nearly an additional 110,000 children who will be severely acutely malnourished and at risk of dying. Along with recent increases due to worsening insecurity and COVID-19, there will be nearly 1 million children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Afghanistan over the next year. ([UNICEF, 31 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3743034))

Drastic reduction in rainfall has caused levels of food and water scarcity across 25 provinces in Afghanistan not seen since the drought of 2018 that displaced a quarter of a million people. An International Rescue Committee assessment of drought impact in Herat, Badghis, Pakitya, Helmand and Khost provinces has shown that 83% of 484 people interviewed are already experiencing displacement within their communities. Interviewees said that some families are being pushed towards extreme survival measures such as selling off their assets, livestock reducing the number of meals, and child marriage. 75% respondents reported an increase in conflict arising in areas where water supplies have depleted. 81% of participants with children under the age of 5 reported diarrhea and illness owing to a lack of clean water. ([IRC, 15 Jun 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3747516))

On 22 June, the Government of Afghanistan officially declared a drought in the country. Little snow pack accumulation over the winter months and low rainfall in recent weeks resulted in drought conditions, low crop yields and rising food prices in the southern, eastern and western parts of the country. In the South, farmers in Kandahar Province are reporting water shortages which are threatening agricultural outputs. In the East, reduced food production is expected to contribute to an already dire food security situation exacerbated by the effects of La Niña and a continued dry spell. In the West, the provinces of Hirat, Badghis and Ghor are facing either extreme or severe drought conditions and humanitarian partners are assisting vulnerable people with food, water, sanitation and hygiene, cash and the rehabilitation of water sources. In the North-East region, drought does not pose an immediate threat at present, but forecasted water shortages may affect 60 per cent of farmers (about 586,000 people) in 12 districts during the upcoming agricultural seasons beginning in September 2021. The declaration of the drought comes at a time when Afghanistan is experiencing a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases and intensifying conflict against the background of ongoing peace talks and the withdrawal of US forces. In total, more than 12 million people – about one third of the population – are facing high levels of acute food insecurity due to high food prices, conflict, COVID-19, and widespread unemployment. ([OCHA, 28 Jun 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3751859))

According to the Pre-Lean Season Assessment (PLSA), conducted across the country in Quarter 1 of 2021, on average, cereal stocks of the prior harvest lasted only five months for the entire households interviewed. Across all areas, only a small proportion (10 per cent) of households reported having cereal stocks from their products that would last till the next harvest. Access to wheat seeds remained a significant challenge. According to PLSA, 81 per cent of
farmers did not have access to certified wheat seeds to cultivate their lands during the last season. PLSA findings show that in rural areas, 53 per cent of people generate income from agriculture, while in the urban areas, only 9 percent of people do. Economic access to food is seriously compromised because of a significant increase in prices. Overall, an estimated 10-20 per cent price increase has been observed compared with the same period of the last five years. The increase is mainly due to the drought, COVID-19 related impacts, steadily accelerating year-on-year inflation and seasonal changes. To further compound the situation, the PLSA indicated a reduction in income for 75 per cent of people and an increase in debt. Around 73 per cent of households reported having debt, and 74 per cent cited food as the main reason for borrowing. With the increasing dependency on the market due to relatively lower production, increased prices, and debt, financial access to food is constrained for most households, as evidenced by the livelihood coping
strategy. One out of five households (20 per cent) adopted Emergency livelihood coping strategies, and 24 per cent resorted to Crisis livelihood coping strategies to mitigate their food consumption gaps. Moreover, the above-mentioned issues are compounded with years of conflict and instability that have caused livelihood disruption and displacements. Despite efforts for a peace deal, this has not yet translated into a sustained reduction in violence. In the first half of 2021, an estimated 140,691 people have been displaced. Internal displacement was limited to new IDPs. Still, IDPs from previous years were unable to return to their places of origin mainly because of continued conflict, loss of livelihoods, and a lack of economic opportunities. ([IFRC, 12 Jul 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3755666))

According to the government, in 2021, the country’s wheat crop will be reduced by nearly two million tons due to this. More than three million livestock are also in danger of death due to lack of fodder and water. The drought has also exacerbated the hard living conditions in a country that is grappling with escalating conflict, COVID-19 and crippling poverty. COVID-19 cases have steadily risen since mid-May 2021, with compounding socioeconomic impacts. Moreover, the years of conflict and instability have caused livelihood disruption and displacements. Despite efforts for a peace deal, this has not yet translated into a sustained reduction in violence. In the first half of 2021, an estimated 140,691 people have been displaced due to armed clashes. Still, internally displaced people (IDPs) from previous years are unable to return to their places of origin mainly because of continued conflict, loss of livelihoods, and a lack of economic opportunities. The ongoing complex humanitarian emergencies – with the drought being the worst – in the country have not only increased the vulnerability but have severely impacted the living conditions and livelihoods in many parts of the country. The impacted populations are in need of emergency food assistance, lifesaving health care, and means to restore and protect their livelihoods. Currently, around 11 million people are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity due to conflict, COVID-19, high food prices, and rampant unemployment. ([IFRC, 3 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3761564))

Needs assessments and response such as health, nutrition, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene activities continued across the country. In the last week, 44,000 people received humanitarian aid in the north-east, while 22,000 people affected by drought received humanitarian assistance in the north. Decades of conflict and a severe drought has exacerbated the situation for vulnerable people. The economic situation continues to be of major concern in terms of the continuity of basic services and impact on the most vulnerable people. Price increases of staples continue to be reported along with scarcity of basic commodities which will impact overall humanitarian needs going forward. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3769675))

In a drought declaration by the government on 22 June 2021, the country’s wheat crop will be reduced by nearly two million tons. Additionally, more than three million livestock are in danger of perishing due to a lack of fodder and water. The winter season will start in October with a potential for severe impact on drought-affected and displaced people whose coping capacities are already weakened. The compounding impacts of drought and conflict which escalated in July and the first half of August have exacerbated the hard living conditions in a country that is also grappling with COVID-19 and poverty. ([IFRC, 6 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3771949))

During the reporting period (1–15 September), 177,500 drought affected-people in Balkh and Nimroz provinces were assisted with water trucking. Water trucking is a last resort option to avoid displacements in areas where people rely on rainwater due to unavailability of potable water or due to high salinity groundwater [...] Afghanistan is currently facing the second drought in four years and consequent water scarcity which is impacting a third of the country. The WASH Cluster stress that the current drought is first and foremost a water scarcity crisis. In addition to the precipitation forecast, there is urgent need to set up a nationwide groundwater monitoring systems to closely follow the water levels across the country. ([OCHA, 23 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3776659/))

In September and October 2021 (the post-harvest season), nearly 19 million people in Afghanistan experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), an almost 30% increase from the same season last year (14.5 million people). The main drivers of acute food insecurity include drought and its impacts on crops and livestock, the collapse of public services, a severe economic crisis and increasing food prices. An estimated 6.8 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 11.9 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) require urgent action to save their lives, reduce food gaps and protect their livelihoods. Between November 2021 and March 2022 (the winter lean season), a further deterioration in food security is expected, with the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above increasing to 22.8 million, a nearly 35% increase from the same season last year (16.9m). Out of 22.8 million people, 14 million will likely be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 8.7 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The number of areas in Emergency is expected to significantly increase in the projection analysis period from 21 to 32 analytical domains. It is likely that household food access between the end of winter and the following spring season will further deteriorate due to: the continuing La Niña climatic episode bringing below-average winter precipitation for the second consecutive year, the impact of high food prices, sanctions on the de facto authorities, growing unemployment and possibly increased displacement. Reduced incomes, lower international and domestic remittances and continuing obstacles to humanitarian assistance (many related to the financial crisis and limited physical access during the winter period) are expected to contribute to the deterioration of food security. ([IPC, 25 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3785295/))

During the reporting period (1 September–31 October), WASH Cluster partners assisted 198,656 drought-affected people across Balkh, Badghis, Kandahar, Hilmand and Wardak province with water trucking to avoid displacement. The country is currently facing the second drought in four years and the worst of its kind in 27 years. The recently updated Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis shows the food security situation has further deteriorated with worrying implications for the winter lean season ahead. [...] In rural areas, this is largely driven by the drought. Assessments show that even after harvest, 57 per cent of households do not have food reserves that would last for 3 months. In urban areas, income loss (driven by economic shocks) has contributed to the rapid deterioration in food insecurity. 10 out of 11 most densely populated urban areas are anticipated to be in IPC 4 (Emergency). ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3788440))

Between 1 September and 15 November, UN and partners provided 7.2 million people with food assistance; reached more than 880,000 people with primary and secondary health-care consultations; they assisted almost 199,000 drought-affected people through water trucking; and treated more than 178,000 children under five for acute malnutrition. Afghanistan’s Flash Appeal seeking $606 million to help 11 million people most in need in the last four months of 2021 is 100 per cent funded. However, all financial commitments have not been translated into actions on the ground, due to financial system challenges amid the cash and liquidity crisis. ([OCHA, 22 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794125))

More than 507,728 people were reached with WASH assistance including through hygiene promotion and hygiene kits between 1 September and 15 December. WASH Cluster partners have continued to assist 204,033 drought-affected people with water trucking – with operations ongoing across Badghis, Kandahar, and Nimroz provinces. Water trucking is a last resort option to avoid displacements in areas where people rely on rainwater due to unavailability of potable water or due to high salinity groundwater. 8,329 wells across 24 provinces are benefitting from regular chlorination able to support up to 3 million people. [...] Drought is not only a food security crisis – the drop down of safe drinking water and water for handwashing have led to the spread of the Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreak, particular affecting children. 18 provinces are currently facing catastrophic AWD situation.

Between 1 September and 30 December, WFP reached approximately 9.4 million people with food assistance across 34 provinces. The majority of this consists of unconditional emergency food or cash-based assistance to meet emergency food needs and protect livelihoods as well as support to displaced populations (IDPs, refugees and returnees). The number of people requiring assistance is more than what was planned under the Appeal mainly due to the increased food insecurity as highlighted by the last IPC report.

Two-thirds of the population (66 percent) are now resorting to crisis coping strategies - a staggering eight percentage point increase from the previous month and a sixfold increase since 15 August' Many (60 percent) are resorting to four or more strategies, and parents are increasingly restricting their own meals just so their children can eat (66 percent)...As of end-January, 95 percent of the population have insufficient food consumption. Some areas saw a deterioration, such as the Central Highlands and North regions where food consumption is already the poorest. In addition, the number of people with severe food insecurity increased in Kabul, North and West regions.  ([WFP, 31 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3818714/))

Two-thirds of the population of Afghanistan are now resorting to crisis-level coping strategies to feed their families. This is an eight percentage point increase from December and a sixfold increase since August 2021, according to WFP’s latest Food Security Update for Afghanistan. Almost 100 percent of female-headed households are facing insufficient food consumption. Eight in ten households experienced a significant decrease in income during the month of January. Households in Kabul were hit the hardest, where some families braved the harsh winter season without any income at all. 22.8 million people – half of the population – are projected to be acutely food insecure in 2022, including 8.7 million at risk of famine-like conditions, with all 34 provinces are facing crisis or emergency levels of acute food insecurity. ([OCHA, 7 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3824732))

The severe drought affecting most of the country since early 2021 has crippled crop production and livestock, leading to critical food shortages. Food insecurity is affecting both rural and urban areas. Ten out of 11 most densely populated urban areas are projected to be under IPC 4 – emergency food insecurity, due to the developments in the country that have driven up unemployment, prices of food and household items as well as cashflow problems (unavailability of remittances and salary payments). The snowfall during the 2021-2022 winter season has remained low, which is likely to further exacerbate the drought situation in the new agricultural year. ([IFRC, 26 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3831467))

While humanitarian assistance is driving down severe food insecurity in several regions of Afghanistan, the number of people facing insufficient food consumption remains alarmingly high, with only 7 percent of people reported having enough to eat in March. The results of an ongoing Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment are expected soon. Currently, 22.8 million people in Afghanistan are acutely food insecure (IPC 3 and 4). In April, WFP reached 12 million people with food & nutrition support. Between January and March 2022, humanitarian partners reached 18 million people with at least one form of humanitarian assistance, including 17.6 million vulnerable people; 174,000 cross-border returnees; 74,000 refugees; 66,000 people affected by floods and other weather-related events; and 65,000 newly displaced people. ([OCHA, 2 May 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3843860))

High acute food insecurity persists across Afghanistan, as a combination of a collapsing economy and drought is depriving nearly 20 million Afghans of
food, classified in Crisis or Emergency (IPC Phases 3 or 4), between March and May 2022 (the lean season). Among these, about 6.6 million people
are classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), characterized by large food gaps and/or employing emergency coping strategies to access food. For the first time since the introduction of IPC in Afghanistan, Catastrophe conditions (IPC Phase 5) were detected for 20,000 people in the province of Ghor, one of the most remote, vulnerable provinces of Afghanistan and immediate action is needed to prevent further deterioration. In the projected period, between June and November 2022, harvest will allow a minimal improvement in food availability and access, from 19.7 Million people facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) to 18.9 million. Overall, 13 million will likely be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 6 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). At household level, the situation is compounded by the forecasted reduction of Humanitarian Food Assistance (HFA) after the month of May. HFA is expected to decrease from 38% of the population receiving on average two third food ration in the current period, to 8% in the June-November projection due to lack
of funding. ([IPC, 9 May 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3844817))

Hunger levels continue to stagnate at alarming levels. For nearly nine months, over 90 percent of the population have faced insufficient food consumption. Despite marginal improvements, coinciding with further humanitarian food assistance and the end of winter, Afghanistan still faces the highest prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally.' A concerning number of people are still turning to drastic coping strategies. Gradual improvements have been observed each month since February for the wider population. However, female-headed households are still largely relying on coping strategies (87 percent), with no clear trend of improvement for nearly nine months. Households are now spending 87 percent of their income on food - up from 85 and 83 percent in April and March respectively. ([WFP, 27 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3860592))

The situation remains precarious as household income continues to shrink. For the second month in a row, the country saw an increase in the proportion of households with deteriorating incomes. In June, this increased by an alarming 10 percentage points. Recurrent drought and erratic climatic shocks are also expected to result in a below average harvest - further threatening incomes and livelihoods.' People are spending almost all of their remaining income on food. Average expenditure on food has now increased to 90 percent - the highest since January 2022 (80 percent).' Female-headed households are spending an even higher proportion of their income on food (94 percent). This comes as incomes are shrinking and prices for key commodities are rising.  More than half of the population is still turning to drastic measures to put food on the table. ([WFP, 27 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3870287))

An estimated 18.9 million people in Afghanistan are acutely food-insecure (IPC 3+), according to the May 2022 IPC Analysis, including 6 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and 13 million in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Continued humanitarian assistance in Ghor Province is needed to deter IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) conditions, which affected some 20,000 people between March and May. Afghanistan continues to face the highest prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally, as some nine in ten households struggle to meet their food needs, according to WFP’s latest Food Security Update: Round Eleven (July 2022). Household food expenditure share continued to increase, reaching 91 percent in July (up from 80 percent in January) while some six in ten households saw their incomes drop.

Prolonged drought across the country, felt hardest in the Southern, Northern, and Western Regions, continued to impact the availability of and access to safe drinking water. A third consecutive La Niña weather event is likely to persist into the 2022-2023 winter, worsening drought conditions. According to the recent Whole of Afghanistan Assessment, 79 per cent  of households reported they do not have sufficient water for their daily needs, including for drinking, cooking, bathing or hygiene. In addition, 64 per cent of households reported that they experienced drought in the six months prior to data collection and 54 per cent experienced economic shock. The impact of both drought and economic shock is having a devastating effect on food security and family coping mechanisms. ([UNICEF, 20 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3908635))

Afghanistan continues to face the highest prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally. Results from WFP’s October Food Security Update show that nine in ten households consumed insufficient food, with little change over the past 12 months. The current food crisis is perpetuated by a concurrent climate crisis, as 30 out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan report extremely low water quality. The proportion of households feeling the impact of drought in 2022 is six times greater than in 2020 as Afghanistan enters its third consecutive drought year.

Sustained humanitarian assistance has effectively reduced the total number of food insecure people in Afghanistan, from 20 million during the winter lean season, to 15.3 million projected for May to October 2023. Continued support is needed to keep the alarming malnutrition and hunger rates from increasing. A 30-35 percent wheat deficit is expected for 2023 following the third consecutive drought year in Afghanistan. While forecasts suggest an overall improvement in wheat production from previous years, western provinces are likely to still experience below-average harvests. ([WFP, 25 Jun 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3975398))

The economy is unable to support a significant percentage of the population. Persistent drought has limited foreign investment, and the loss of international budgetary support has driven the economy downwards. Casual labour opportunities have picked up in some areas, but successive bans on employment have removed the vital contribution which women once made to household income. Overall, it is clear that current economic conditions cannot sustain the majority of Afghan families. Acute hunger remains persistently high. [...] More than 15 million Afghans (35 percent of the population) live in a state of acute hunger, as per the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3+ (crisis), while 2.8 million experience critical Emergency levels of hunger (IPC Phase 4). A marginally better harvest and lower prices might lead to lower food insecurity numbers in the forthcoming forecast period (October 2023 - March 2024). However, the fact remains that between 30 percent and 50 percent of Afghan households currently cannot afford adequate nutritious food. ([WFP, 19 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4007314))

Afghanistan’s economy remains exceedingly fragile, and the food insecurity remains alarmingly high. In October 2023, during the postharvest season, approximately 13.1 million people, accounting for 29 percent of the total population (based on 2024 Flowminder national population estimates) are facing high level of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). The main drivers of this acute food insecurity include challenging economic conditions, high unemployment rates compounded by the limited access to income that reduced purchasing power, in a context of continued high prices of food and agricultural inputs, reduced livelihood opportunities and decreased remittances. The adverse impact of extreme and variable climatic conditions, particularly the multi-year drought experienced between 2021 and 2023, continues to be felt in 2023. Additionally, other natural hazards such as flooding and earthquakes further compromise the limited coping capacity of the population, resulting in the persistence of a severe food insecurity situation. Looking ahead to the projection period between November 2023 and March 2024, corresponding to the winter lean season, a further deterioration in food security is expected, with the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above likely to rise to 15.8 million (36 percent of the total population based on Flowminder 2024 national population estimate), including about 3.6 million people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and about 12.3 million people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Compared to the same period of previous years, the decrease of number of people facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) during the lean season (November 2023 – March 2024), and especially in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), can be attributed predominantly to the extensive, timely and efficient delivery of humanitarian food and agriculture assistance. ([IPC, 14 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4023033))

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are ongoing in northern, western, and central highlands as households have decreased access to typically relevant income sources, and food stocks are limited from the 2023 harvest. [...] Despite the expectation for above-average precipitation associated with the ongoing El Nino, cumulative precipitation from October 2023 to January 2024 remains well below the 40-year average. Most of Afghanistan has received 60 to 90 percent of average precipitation for the October 2023 to late January 2024 period, with areas in northern and eastern Afghanistan recording less than 60 percent of average precipitation. In particular, much of eastern Afghanistan has recorded historically low precipitation between October 1, 2023, and January 25, 2024. ([FEWS Net, 31 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4034404))

At the peak of the lean season, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present in northern, northeastern, and western parts of the county following the early depletion of food stocks from 2023's below-average harvest, limited income-earning opportunities, and a decline in remittances from Iran, which is keeping household purchasing power low.[...] However, average March to May rainfall is expected to support wheat production and agricultural labor opportunities, improving household access to food and income. The start of the harvest in June is expected to improve household food access across the country, with area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes emerging in northern parts of the country as they recover from the multi-year drought. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to remain present in higher elevation areas, where the harvest does not typically occur until October, and household access to income for food purchases is expected to remain low. ([FEWS Net, 9 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4045023))

In January 2024, dry spell conditions gradually emerged in the Western, Northern, and North Eastern regions of the country, intensifying in severity in these areas throughout February and March. The provinces most severely impacted were Hirat, Badghis, Faryab, Jawzjan, Samangan, Baghlan, and Kunduz. Throughout February and March, regions that were moderately affected, such as the southern parts of Hirat, Farah, Nimroz, Hilmand, and most areas of Kandahar, began to recover from drought conditions. However, additional pockets of dry spell developed simultaneously in Uruzgan and Kandahar (Southern Region), as well as Nangahar and Kunar (Eastern Region). ([OCHA, 25 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4057587))

Afghanistan continues to experience marginal improvements in food security since the large degradation in the situation following the political transition of 2021. Nonetheless, over a third of Afghanistan’s population (14.2 million people) are still experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), driven by climatic shocks and high food prices. This includes 2.9 million people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), the majority of whom are located in Badakshan, Baghdis, Ghor, Ghazni, Helmand, Herat (urban and rural), Kunduz, Kandahar and Takhar provinces. ([IPC, 27 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065251))

[...] La Niña conditions are likely to become more prevalent from August-October 2024 and are expected to persist through January-March 2025 with a 70-80 percent likelihood. Consequently, the start of the 2024/25 agricultural season is projected to face challenges, including below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures. [...] In June, conditions continued to improve in Afghanistan, particularly in the provinces of Bamyan, Ghor, Kabul, and Parwan, where vegetation growth was previously negatively impacted from May to mid-June. Despite some remaining pockets of dry spell across these provinces, an overall improvement is observed. By the end of June, a precipitation deficit was observed in a corridor crossing the provinces of Bamyan, Sar-e-Pul, Samangan, and Balkh. ([OCHA, 31 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4082404))

At least 41,200 people have been affected by a heavy storm which has caused extreme flooding on Monday in northern Idlib and western Aleppo. Most of the people affected have already faced years of being uprooted from their homes due to conflict. At least 62 camps and 2,558 tents have been damaged or destroyed by the storm, often sweeping away the only possessions people had after nearly a decade of displacement. Tens of thousands of people scattered to find shelter from the ongoing storm in schools and mosques. Others were forced to sleep in the open air last night, in temperatures below zero.

Per the National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO), more than 3,900 people remain in 80 shelters due to the La Soufrière volcanic eruption despite the 25 May Government deadline for people from communities outside the still-restricted red zone to return home. Although transportation from shelters is available, people are still clearing their homes of ash and cleaning, with many either returning to shelters or having no income or reason to leave. ([OCHA, 31 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3743066))

On 29 December 2020, the La Soufrière volcano alert level in St. Vincent and the Grenadines was elevated due to increased volcanic activity. By 8 April 2021, the alert level increased to Red, with government authorities issuing immediate evacuation orders for nearby communities' volcanoes. On 9 April 2021, La Soufrière erupted for the first time after 40 years, sending an ash plume of 10km into the sky. The resulting ashfall was very heavy in the surrounding areas, reaching nearby islands and halting area air traffic. Subsequent eruptions, lava flows, earthquakes, ash plumes, and seismic activity continued throughout April. In early May, explosions subsided, but seismic activity and the risk of lahars persisted with the increased rainfall. An estimated 23,400 people were displaced to the southern end of St Vincent and the Grenadine and some neighbouring countries. They were originally received in 85 government-run formal collective shelters (4,417 persons) and informal collective shelters like hotels and rented residences. Many are private homes hosted by family and friends (18,927 persons). Unfortunately, the data provided by NEMO was not desegregated, making the identification of more specific needs of the population more difficult without further inquiry. These numbers were challenging to track at the onset of the disaster with multiple registration sources but have since been centralized, verified, and corrected by the Ministry of National Mobilization and NEMO. On 6 May 2021, the Government of St. Vincent, and the Grenadines, with the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO), lowered the Volcanic Alert Level from Red to Orange, noting that no significant activity had been observed since the April 22 eruptions. Accordingly, school resumed on May 17 for students scheduled to write external examinations this year. On 20 May, the Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines announced that persons displaced from most of the orange and some parts of the red volcano hazard zones could return home (except Chateaubelair and Fitz-Hughes communities in the Orange Zone). In addition, the community of Georgetown in the Red Zone was to be returning home by 1 June. However, access to the Red Zone areas north of Georgetown on the Windward side of St. Vincent remains hazardous, and the potential for injury remains. Residents are also asked not to visit the La Soufrière volcano. According to the 31 May UWI Seismic Research Centre update, persistent steaming is observable from the observatory once the cloud cover is high enough. The volcano continues to be in a state of unrest. Escalation inactivity can still take place with little or no warning. NEMO is looking to re-establish remote sensors on the volcanoes to help determine the hazard and potentially open the last zones to returns. As of 1 June, 72 collective shelters managed by the Ministry of Education (MoE) are still open (two of these are expected to relocate remaining families).

Approximately USD 11.1 million (38 percent) has been raised under the USD 29.2 million UN Global Funding Appeal to support Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

People sheltered due to the April volcano eruption have been cleared to return to their homes. The Government has lowered their Volcanic Alert level for the La Soufrière volcano from ORANGE to YELLOW five months after the volcano’s April 2021 eruption that prompted the UN in Barbados to launch a USD 29 million appeal. With the downgraded alert, residents who had evacuated from areas surrounding the volcano are now allowed to return to their homes, with the shelter population last reported to be at around 393 in 19 shelters. The National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) indicates that while the La Soufriere’s activity levels have declined over the past three months, the volcano is still restless and exhibiting seismic and/or fumarolic activity above historical levels before the April eruption. Lahars and heavy steaming and degassing will persist for some time during high rains, presenting an added threat ahead of the peak of the 2021 hurricane season.

On 30 January, Tropical Cyclone Ana followed a similar path as Tropical Cyclone Yasa but made landfall westwards over the main island of Viti Levu. TC Ana entered Fiji waters as a Category 2 cyclone but brought a lot of rain causing widespread flooding across the Central, Western and Northern Divisions. Impacts of TC Ana have been felt across the whole country. Worst impacted are the communities in the provinces of Macuata and Cakaudrove that were still recovering from TC Yasa. As of 2 February, Fiji National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) reported 14,755 evacuees in 422 evacuation centres across the country. Extensive flooding caused damage to infrastructure with 131 roads and crossings temporarily closed. All major roads in Vanua Levu remained closed cutting off supply of food and relief items to affected areas. There have been two confirmed fatalities and three people reported missing. The main concerns are increased risk of leptospirosis, typhoid, dengue and diarrhoea due to poor water access and standing water. Hygiene is a concern due to the lack of access to clean water. Early recovery efforts for livelihoods, fixing shelters and access to food and water are all required, acknowledging future cyclones may occur before the cyclone season ends in May 2021.

Sri Lanka: Floods - Dec 2020,"The Northeast monsoon and activation of a depression in the south-east Bay of Bengal have been intensifying rainfall in Sri Lanka from 2 to 5 December 2020 where the northern province of Sri Lanka is worst affected. Sri Lanka’s Department of Meteorology has reported a maximum rainfall up to 279.8 millimetres in the northern province particularly in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts. During this period two deaths have been reported in Jaffna district and the Government of Sri Lanka has declared a local level emergency in the Northern Province, hence schools and other institutions in the province were closed. The continuous rains are still inundating most of the low-lying areas in the two districts and have caused damages to residential areas. As this situation is intensifying, agricultural lands and standing crops are also inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. As of 10th December, It is expected that this heavy rainfall is going to continue, which will have an impact and further exacerbate the capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas.

Indonesia: Ili Lewotolok Volcano - Nov 2020,"On Sunday, 29 November 2020 at 13.00 hours, Central Indonesia Time (GMT+8), Indonesia’s Centre for Vulcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation (Pusat Vulkanologi dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi – PVMBG) raised the alert level from Level 2 (advisory) to Level 3 (watch/alert) after increasing activity of Ili Lewotolok Volcano (also known as Ile Lewotolo). The volcano is located in the northern part of Lembata island, East Nusa Tenggara (Nusa Tenggara Timur– NTT) Province. An alert Level 3 warrants a danger zone of up to 4 kilometres from the volcano since there is the potential for further eruptions. 

From Friday, 27 November 2020 to Thursday, 3 December 2020, Ili Lewotolok Volcano recorded 27 eruptions. PVMBG observed the height of the ash column between 200 – 4,000 meters above the peak of the volcano and advised people in the vicinity of Ili Lewotolok Volcano to keep a safe distance because the volcano spews volcanic bombs in all directions. Moreover, heavy ash fall was reported in areas close to the volcano. PVMBG further warned the public of the dangers of exposure to volcanic materials, such as eye injuries, suffocation, and respiratory problems. 

On 1 December 2020, Lembata Distict government declared a Disaster Emergency Alert (Tanggap Darurat Bencana) within its administrative area. At the time of writing, there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage due to the eruptions. Nevertheless, at least 7,968 people from 17 villages in Ile Ape sub-district and nine villages in Ile Ape Timur Sub-district had been evacuated. The evacuees are dispersed across 13 evacuation centres in Lembata District.

The hardest hit were 13 villages in Iskushuban district, including Xaafuun, Dul Xaafuun, Dardaare, Garan, Baarmadowe, Hurdiya, Foocaar, Afdhicin, Haluula, Kurduush, Gumbax, Taageer and Xandha. Local authorities report that eight people have been killed and an unknown number injured. In total, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected. In Xaafuun and Hurdiya villages, about 15,000 people have been displaced to higher ground within their neighbourhoods. Massive damage to property and roads is reported. Telecommunication services have also been affected, especially in Xaafuun, Hurdiya and Baarmadowe. In addition, shipping and fishing activities along the coastal areas of Bari and the Gulf of Aden have been disrupted. An estimated 30 fishermen who were at sea before the cyclone alert was issued are yet to be accounted for. ([OCHA, 23 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690583))

The tropical storm GATI has weakened further and is moving westwards with a speed of 7KPH. It is expected to dissipate in the next 12 hours. The storm left behind a significant physical and economic damage especially in Bari region. More than 700 houses were destroyed, several boats and fishing gears damaged and loss of a large number of livestock. This has led to loss of livelihood for most families and may take time and huge financial input to replace the loss. There was a reduction of rainfall amounts and wind speeds in the last 24 hours in many areas along the storm path. This trend is expected to continue as the storm gets weaker and the situation will stabilize thereafter. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3691003))

GATI made landfall at Ras Hafun with maximum sustained winds of 170Km/hr; and classified as a Category 2 storm. The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) raised its impact score to “ORANGE” (1.5 out of 3) and forecast the expected level of humanitarian impact of the cyclone as “MEDIUM”: It brought more than a year’s worth of rain to the region in two days. By 25 November 2020, TC GATI had dissipated but it left trail of destruction across Bari and Sanaag regions of Somalia. Coastal communities have been disproportionately affected, with considerable damage reported to infrastructure, livelihoods, and social services (communication, electricity, roads, schools). Rainfall has also resulted in flooding which has caused sewerage to overflow; and increasing the risk of disease among the affected population. According to authorities, an estimated 180,000 people (30,000 households) have been affected, with 42,000 people (7,000 households) displaced across Puntland and Somaliland (UNOCHA).

Hurricane Eta - Nov 2020,"Hurricane Eta began affecting north-eastern Nicaragua and parts of northern Honduras in the early hours of 3 November, causing heavy rains and high winds as a Category 4 hurricane. Preliminary reports indicate flooding and wind damage as Eta continues its projected westward path over northern Nicaragua. The United States’ National Hurricane Center (NHC) projects that Eta will cross into central Honduras by midday on 4 November and then reach eastern Guatemala and Belize on 5 November at night, passing over northern El Salvador during this time, before turning north-east back out into the Caribbean Sea by 7 November. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3684778))

Eta has downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves into eastern and central Honduras at 11 km/h with windspeeds of 65 km/h. Despite Eta’s decreased intensity and lower windspeeds, Nicaragua continues to take on moderate, but persistent, rainfall throughout much of the country, with meteorological forecasts citing more than 600mm through 8 November. Eta’s slow movement and ongoing impact, coupled with the remote locations of areas along Nicaragua’s north-eastern Caribbean shores that have taken the brunt of Eta’s effects, are limiting full and complete evaluations. Eta is expected to continue weakening as it interacts with mountainous terrain in Nicaragua and Honduras, potentially weakening to a tropical depression by 4 November at night. 

Nicaragua’s National Disaster Prevention System (SINAPRED) reports that Eta, now on its way out of **Nicaragua**, has thus far caused two deaths due to a landslide in the mining area of Bonanza. Preliminary reports cite material damages, uprooted trees, interruptions to power supply, flooding and blocked roads and affected bridges. Official sources report that there are 30,000 people sheltered across 48 installations, including churches, schools, shelters and family homes. 

After almost a month since the landfall of Eta, Nicaragua estimates over 3 million people affected, as well as significant infrastructure damages in 56 municipalities, including approximately 43,000 damaged / destroyed homes. The Government response continues to focus on restoring basic service access for water, power and telecommunications. According to Government communications.

Eta’s rains are also causing flooding, damages and humanitarian impacts in **Honduras**, with the Permanent Commission for Contingencies (COPECO) reporting more than 3,480 people affected and 1 death as of 12:00am local time 4 November. Honduran Armed Forces report supporting the evacuation of more than 2,500 people, indicating that 1,340 are in shelters. Material damages include nearly 350 affected homes, as well as several road blockages that have cut off 41 communities.

With Eta crossing into Honduras, outer band rains began falling over **Guatemala** in the past 24 hours, triggering flooding in several areas. Per the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED), the rains and subsequent flooding and landslides have thus far affected 27,770 people across the departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén, Quiché and Sololá.

In **El Salvador**, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) reports that Eta is causing high winds of up to 30 km/h in parts of the capital of San Salvador that have already led to fallen trees and debris.

The National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) anticipates that Eta’s major threat is heavy rainfall and flooding, with some locations across the country already taking on 50mm of rain. NEMO ехресts rainfall to last until 9-11 November, posing a high flood risk across **Веlіzе**.

In **Costa Rica**, the National Emergency Commission (CNE) reports that hazardous rains related to Eta have affected 79 communities, mostly in the north-western Pacific coast.

During the same period, Mahdia and all belonging localities recorded more than 40 mm of rain in 24 hours during 3 separate days. Kairouan recorded 89 mm of rain. Kef governorate registered similar amounts of rain especially in Sers locality. During that period almost an average of a monthly rain was registered.

Flooding and related fatalities were reported in the governorates of Monastir, Sousse, Mahdia, Sfax and Tunis, according to the country’s Civil Protection Agency. Floods struck several districts of the capital, Tunis. Some areas were under 1 meter of water, leaving roads impassable and buildings damaged. Orthopedic hospital in the governorate of Manouba was flooded; water reaching archives and hospitalization rooms National Institute of Meteorology (Institut national de la météorologie) of Tunisia issued warnings for further heavy rainfall on 13 and 14th of September. Consequently, floodwater surged through many different districts damaging infrastructure, houses, properties, and livelihoods of the community members.

During this period, media reports said at least 6 people have died in floods after days of torrential rainfall in Tunisia, hundreds were rescued and thousands of homes damaged.

More than 40,000 people have been affected by the floods. Some of them fled their homes seeking shelter in neighboring high-ground houses and communities, while other chose to stay in their damaged houses moving to rooftops rather than risking crossing flooded areas to reach evacuation points. Water supply through pipelines is limited, and the water available in some areas is contaminated. Electricity has been cut off in certain districts to avoid risk to people and electrical damage.

At least 5.2 million children under age 5 live in the affected states and will require urgent vaccination. The outbreak, the first since March 2009, has been considered by the authorities as a national emergency and response has been activated to tackle the high risk of transmissions within and beyond Sudan, including South Sudan, declared by WHO as polio-free just a month ago. Neighbouring Ethiopia, Central African Republic and Chad also reported cases, which puts more risks on Sudan, especially in the Darfur region, due to border movements. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current floods in Sudan will likely increase the challenges for Government and humanitarian partners to contain the new outbreak. The FMoH and health partners have already activated the urgent response to the outbreak. The FMoH briefed the Cabinet of Ministers on 8 August and declared the outbreak one day later, following the protocols of the International Health Regulations.

Mauritius: MV Wakashio Oil Spill - Aug 2020,"On 25 July 2020, a bulk carrier vessel, MV Wakashio, ran aground on the reef of Point d’Esny, off the coast of Mauritius. The vessel was carrying nearly 4,200 metric tons (MT) of fuel, including low-sulphur fuel oil (3,894 MT), diesel (207 MT) and lubricant oil (90 MT). The ship is located near ecologically sensitive and important areas, including the Point d’Esny Wetlands, Ile aux Aigrettes Nature Reserve, Blue Bay Marine Area, Mahebourg Fishing Reserves, barachois (coastal lagoons) and mangroves. The Point d’Esny Wetlands are designated as a site of international importance under the Convention on Wetlands (‘Ramsar Convention’). The Nagashiki Shipping Co. Ltd, which owns and manages the vessel, told media in an emailed statement that “due to bad weather and constant pounding over the past few days, the starboard side bunker tanker has been breached and an amount of fuel oil has escaped into the sea.” Preliminary satellite analysis conducted by UNOSAT found that the shipwreck location was approximately 2 kilometres from the shore at Point d’Esny and that 0.23km2 oil spill was observed by 6 August. Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has declared a “state of environmental emergency” and said that the sinking of the boat “represents a danger” for the people of Mauritius. The country’s approximately 1.3 million inhabitants rely heavily on tourism, which has already been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Reports indicate that the oil is likely to drift northwards, with sightings as far north as Bambous Virieux.
Many people in the affected areas rely on fishing for their livelihoods, which will be impacted by the oil spill.

According to WFP, the floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton. Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable,
thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season. The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters.

Ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. ([OCHA, 16 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3635539))

As of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3641339))

Flash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 peope are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. ([OCHA, 26 Jul 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658337))

The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia’s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. ([UNHCR, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659748))

Riverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.

At least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May. Since the beginning of the country’s ‘long rains’ season in early March, more than 233,000 people have been affected, including over 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society. Flooding has been reported in more than three quarters of Kenya’s counties (36 out of 47), with landslides reported in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the Government’s National Disaster Operations Centre. The Kenya Meteorological Department forecasts aboveaverage rainfall throughout May in parts of the Rift Valley, and in the central, western and coastal regions of Kenya, which could result in further flooding. The heavy rains have increased the risk of health emergencies and provided conditions conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts in Kenya.

Burundi: Floods and Landslides - Apr 2020,"Torrential rains, violent winds, landslides, and floods that occurred between 13 and 19 April have caused devastation in Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Bujumbura Rural provinces. On 19 April, according to local authorities, 27,972 people were displaced due to the Ruzizi river overflowing into six districts of Gatumba in Mutimbuzi Commune (Bujumbura Rural province). 6,010 houses were flooded, severely damaged or destroyed. Strong winds, torrential rains, and landslides have affected a total of 813 people in Rumonge province (715) and Bubanza province (98), the majority of whom are now displaced. The damage toll is still rising as flooded houses continue to collapse. ([OCHA, 22 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3615219))

In affected provinces, up to 160 homes were destroyed and 70 partially damaged, alongside 7,600 inundated in Mutimbuzi commune. Heavy and above-average rainfall is anticipated to continue until mid-May, potentially increasing displacement and testing coping capacity. Capacity to provide aid may be restricted throughout the upcoming rains, particularly as elections in May may divert government attention and resources. If flood water is untreated and people cannot access safe water, cholera and malaria may further spread. ([ACAPS, 1 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3629439))

Over 2,100 victims of severe flooding and mudslides in Burundi are receiving help from IOM, the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Weeks of torrential rain have hit Burundi affecting 45,000 people and sweeping away thousands of homes and businesses, leaving 18,000 people newly displaced. Three large displacement sites for victims have emerged around Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura, where thousands are living in temporary or makeshift accommodations. There are concerns the new displacement sites could increase their risk of contracting COVID-19, due to their overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. IOM under the coordination of OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and other UN agencies here are moving to reduce risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 during distributions of shelter, hygiene kits, and other types of emergency support.

Flooding has destroyed thousands of hectares of crops that were ready for harvest (mainly pulses and cereals), depriving the locals of essential food stocks for the coming year. With over 80 per cent of the population reliant on subsistence farming, already vulnerable communities will likely suffer a difficult lean season due to insufficient harvests, as well as increased market prices.

Tropical Cyclone Harold - Apr 2020,"Mid-day of 3 April 2020, TC Harold had moved into the Vanuatu's area of responsibility and is tracked through the Vanuatu Tropical Cyclone Tracking Map. At 22:00 UTC on 4 April, TC Harold was a category 4 tropical cyclone located approximately 95km off the west coast of Santo, Vanuatu. It is currently moving in a south south easterly direction at a rate of 14km/h, with maximum sustained winds close to the centre estimated at 175km/h. Predictions indicate that TC Harold will increase to a category 5 tropical cyclone within the next 12 hours, then weaken to a category 4 tropical cyclone once it has passed over Vanuatu late on Monday evening. Severe weather warning for heavy rainfalls and flash flooding, including possible landslides are expected... The system will slowly move East/Southeast across central islands by Monday or Tuesday next week and expected near west of Fiji by Wednesday 8 April. ([IFRC, 5 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3593288/))

Tropical Cyclone HAROLD continued moving south-east over the Coral Sea and made landfall over southwest coast of Espiritu Santo Island (north Vanuatu) on 6 April around 0.00 UTC, with maximum sustained winds up to 215 km/h. Media reported, as of 06 April, 7 fatalities and 21 people were still missing across Salomon Islands. In addition, media reported, hundreds of people preventively evacuated across Espiritu Santo. ([ECHO, 6 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3593143/))

The northern provinces of Sanma, Malampa and Penama are most affected. Due to its path across the centre of Vanuatu, TC Harold has directly impacted on a large number of populated islands and the large island of Santo with the country’s second largest city Luganville. According to the latest satellite analysis based on the cyclone track and wind speed zones and the population data, at least 112,000 people would be potentially exposed to the strong winds greater than 120km/h. Mobile phone networks on the islands were still down as of 7 April. Two Aerial Surveillance Assessment team were deployed on 7 April to assess the northern provinces and a Rapid Technical Assessment Team is scheduled to be deployed on the ground as soon as conditions allow. ([OCHA, 6 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3596034/))

In the night of 7-8 April TC Harold headed to Fiji where it hit Viti Levu and the islands to the east as a Category 4 cyclone. The cyclone has caused significant power outages, blocked roads due to fallen trees, and widespread flooding. A total of 69 evacuation centers in four divisions have been set up to accommodated 1,778 evacuees. As of 08 of April the Vanuatu’s National Disaster Management Office estimates that up to 160,000 people may have been affected by the cyclone int he country. The provinces of Sanma (53,344 people), Penama (32,055 people), and Malampa (40,917 people) have been categorized as Priority 1 for assistance. The provinces of Torba (10,102 people) and Shepherds Group (23,056 people) have been categorized as Priority 2. ([OCHA, 8 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3597439/))

On 9 April, Vanuatu Government issued a request for in-kind assistance to the European Union. In response, as part of the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism, France is sending tents, shelter kits, kitchen sets and jerry cans. The EU's Copernicus emergency mapping service was activated (EMSR 434) on 6 April, in order to support damage assessment and impact assessment in Vanuatu. In Tonga, significant damage to the water supply and food crops was reported across Tongatapu. Central and Western Tongatapu are expected to be hardest hit due to the king tides and significant flooding. Destruction is widespread, including significant damage to homes, water supply and food crops is reported in 'Eua. Hundreds are reported to be currently sheltering in evacuation centres due to homes being destroyed. In Fiji, telecommunication and electricity networks have been largely restored. Disaster assessments are under way by the national disaster management office ([ECHO, 10 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3599784/)).

The humanitarian response to Cyclone Harold continues and assessments are ongoing in the most affected areas of Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga. Initial findings from an assessment in Sanma Province in Vanuatu indicate that an estimated 80 – 90% of the population lost their houses, while some 60% of schools and 20% of health centres may be damaged. Food crops are seriously damaged. In Fiji, the Government made a Declaration of Natural Disaster for TC Harold on 12 April. As of 13 April, more than 1,800 evacuees are being sheltered in 65 evacuation centres in Fiji, while in Tonga, 17 evacuation centres are sheltering 323 people and an estimated 428 houses have been damaged. UN agencies and NGO partners are supporting the National Disaster Management Authorities and are releasing prepositioned relief items for the response with additional in-kind and logistical support from the FRANZ alliance. On 13 April, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund released USD$ 2.5 million for the response in Vanuatu ([OCHA, 14 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3602729/)).

In Vanuatu, an estimated 160,000 people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Harold which hit the island state on 6 April. The provinces of Sanma, Malampa and Penama were hardest hit. Assessments are ongoing by Government and humanitarian partners, including the UN, and the Pacific Humanitarian Team is supporting government-led efforts to respond to needs. Logistics in the response have been hampered by difficult local conditions following the cyclone as well as by COVID-19 restrictions that have been put in place for incoming cargo and people.

In Fiji, the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) – with the help of the Fiji Red Cross, UNICEF and other humanitarian partners on the ground, continues to deliver relief items to some 20,000 people who were most affected by TC Harold in the Eastern Division of the country. Evacuation centres in the north and west have closed, but over 1,300 people remain in 105 centers in the Central (13) and Eastern (92) Divisions. As of 21 April, 1,310 people are sheltering in 105 evacuation centres in the Eastern and Central divisions. The eastern division has the highest number of people in evacuation centres with 1,116 evacuees in 92 evacuation centres. All evacuation centres in Northern and Western Divisions are now closed. ([OCHA, 21 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3613959/)).

In Tonga, most people have returned to their homes from evacuation centers and small-scale relief distributions are ongoing through the National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) and the Tongan Red Cross. ([OCHA, 20 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3612759/)).

In Vanuatu, the NDMO – together with various ministries and humanitarian partners on the ground - continues to conduct assessments in the three worst-affected provinces of Sanma, Penama and Malampa. Affected populations (up to 160,000 people) particularly need shelter, access to safe water, and food assistance. The health situation, compounded by COVID-19, is also of concern as a number of health structures have been damaged. A total of 15 Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) have been deployed across the three most affected provinces to provide basic health care and – together with the Food and Nutrition Cluster – to assess the nutrition situation and distribute nutrition supplements. ([OCHA, 27 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3622974/)).

There has been an increase in response activity with more shelter relief items now being distributed. Concerns remain that this is still very slow and of the estimated 17,347 households in destroyed & severely damaged categories only around 1,954 households have received emergency shelter assistance. This means that only around 11% of houses in the higher damage categories have received emergency shelter assistance. There is currently enough stock in-country to cover 36% of emergency shelter needs ([Govt. of Vanuatu, IFRC, Shelter Cluster, 30 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3631945/)).

The Vanuatu Shelter Cluster now estimates that there is enough available to address humanitarian shelter needs of approximately 82 per cent of households whose homes have been severely damaged or destroyed. However, only 13% of households in need have received shelter assistance so far. As of 6 May, there are 610 people in 79 evacuation centers in Fiji. According to the Agriculture final assessment report at least 53,000 farmers have been affected by TC Harold, with the cost of damage to crops and livestock estimated to be FJD29 million. In Toga, UNICEF has supported MIA to provide psychosocial support (PSS) and counseling for 300 children and 840 community members in Siesia island and Patangata village, Tongatapu; PSS/counseling for 1200 children delivered through most affected schools in Hihifo and Kolofo’ou districts, Tongatapu; PSS support to 45 families in Eua island. In Solomon Islands initial assessment show 25 schools in three provinces - Guadalcanal, Makira Ulawa, Central Islands – have been damaged or destroyed. Damage has been reported to classrooms, specialized classrooms, WASH infrastructures and staff houses, as well as learning/teaching resources. ([OCHA, 7 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3632582/))

In Vanuatu, at least 60 percent of croplands have been severely damaged by the cyclone according to early estimates by FAO. Based on the Rapid Technical Assessment report of the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), food crops as well as export crops have been uprooted and snapped at the trunk by the strong winds. At household level, severe losses of stored crops and seeds as well as small livestock were reported. International food aid and agricultural assistance, in the form of vegetable seeds, planting material and farming equipment, are urgently needed to facilitate crop replanting and to prevent the deterioration of the food security situation. FAO is working with the Vanuatu Food Security and Agriculture Cluster and the NDMO to restore agricultural production and rebuild people's livelihoods ([FAO, 8 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3632890/)).

Humanitarian programmes continue to respond to the needs of people affected by Cyclone Harold. In Fiji, damage to crops and livestock is reported to be approximately FJD29 million and as of 10th May, a total of 610 people remain in 79 evacuation centres in the Central (8) and Eastern (71) Divisions respectively. Humanitarian response is continuing with emphasis on WASH, Food Security, Shelter and Health. In Vanuatu, the National Disaster Management Office has organized 12 shipments of food and non-food items (tents, tarpaulins, medical supplies, fuel) to affected areas since 10 April and a Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) of USD2.58 million was approved for live-saving activities to assist 109,000 people in need ([OCHA, 12 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633780/)).

In Fiji, a total of 610 people are still hosted in 79 evacuation centers in the Central (8) and Eastern (71) Divisions respectively after being displaced by Tropical Cyclone Harold over one month ago. The humanitarian response is ongoing, and is focusing on water and sanitation, food security, shelter, and health response activities. An allocation from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has been approved with US$1M to provide assistance to 200,000 people in need ([OCHA, 19 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3636094/)).

Since 28 March, flash floods following heavy rain affected 18 provinces in north-central and west regions of Afghanistan. Preliminary information suggests that floods have killed 11 people, while 15 people are injured. Most affected provinces are Farah, Badghis, Faryab, Baghlan, Takhar and Parwan. Needs assessments are coordinated by the local authorities and humanitarian agencies. The flash floods displaced families. At least 288 houses were completely destroyed, and 400 houses were partially damaged. Furthermore 500 hectares of agricultural crops were washed away.

[OCHA’s natural disaster tracking dashboard](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/afghanistan/natural-disasters-0) shows that more than 15,300 people have been affected by floods (13,900), landslides (616) and avalanches (819) since the start of the year. During flood-related displacement, host communities tend to extend their limited resources to families in need. Most displaced families are normally hosted by relatives or in neighbouring communities while they wait for the rain to subside prior to starting repair of their shelters. This coping mechanism creates favourable conditions for higher transmission of COVID-19 and in some cases may give rise to protection concerns for displaced people and their hosts. This is particularly concerning for the country’s west and south bordering Iran and Pakistan where flooding is already taking place. IOM and other ES-NFI partners have so far conducted 127 joint assessments in areas affected by floods. Assessment findings showed that more than 1,400 homes have been either damaged or destroyed.

Yemen: Floods - Mar 2020,"Heavy rains hit southern parts of Yemen on 24 and 25 March, affecting Lahj, Aden, Abyan, Taizz, Al Dale’e, Al Mahrah and Hadramaut governorates badly. In Aden, torrential rains flooded houses and roads in Crater and Al Mualla districts. In Hadramaut, houses, road bridges, water networks, and crops were destroyed and livestock drowned in Al Sawm, Hajr, Mayfa and Brom districts. Sites for internally displaced people (IDPs) were worst affected where rains destroyed shelters and property and led to stagnant water. Initial findings suggest that at least 4,625 families have been affected in 60 IDP sites. ([OCHA, 31 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3583993/))

An estimated 21,240 families (148,680 people) have been affected by flooding in 13 governorates since mid-April. Conditions are hardest for thousands of families already displaced who have lost shelter, food rations and household supplies. In Marib Governorate, torrential rains affected 6,286 families including 7 fatalities while 250 people were injured. The rains also caused houses to collapse, and damaged infrastructure making some roads impassable in Raymah Governorate and Marib City and surrounding areas. In Sana’a and northern governorates, at least 9,146 families were affected, with Sana’a City and most parts of Sana’a governorate particularly badly hit by flooding. Over 5,130 families have been affected in Hajjah Governorate alone, and partners have reported severe damage to shelters at sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs) as a result urgent needs for WASH interventions and food assistance are required. An estimated 4,764 households have been affected in IDP sites in southern governorates, including 1,812 families in Aden, 1,037 in Abyan, 917 in Taizz and 770 in Lahj governorates. In Aden City, the worst affected areas are Crater and Mualla. ([OCHA, 24 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3628009))

During the month of April, Yemen has experienced heavy rains which caused flash floods in different governorates of the country requiring immediate assistance. On 21 April, a tropical storm hit the southern coast of Yemen with highest impact in Lahj, Aden, Taiz, Ad Dali’, Abyan and Hadramawt. According to preliminary assessments, at least 150,000 people were affected across 13 governorates, including 64,000 internally displaced people. According to the UNOCHA Flash Floods Update No.21 and Flash Floods Update No.32, the health authorities in Aden reported on 22 April the deaths of seven people, including four children, while two people were missing. In Crater District, a family of four were reported to have died when their house collapsed, and in Mualla District, three people died and another 27 were injured. In Aden City, local authorities reported that 66 houses were damaged or destroyed. There is widespread damage to private and public property, including many vehicles and food stocks, and some basic services have been cut. The Ministry of Electricity reported a total power outage in Aden City; there was a possibility that power might be restored to some districts within 48 hours, while pumped drinking water was being restored after it stopped for 24 hours. At sites, for internally displaced people (IDPs) across southern governorates, initial assessments indicated that at least 5,537 displaced families were affected by the rains in 69 locations. In Mualla District in Aden, 100 families from the local community have been displaced by the floods besides flooding to two schools.  ([IFRC, 28 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3632328))

Heavy rain has been affecting several Governorates of the country (in particular Hadhramaut, Shabwa and Al Mahrah) since the last few days, causing widespread floods and resulting in casualties and damage. According to media reports, 16 people died in eastern Hadhramaut and central Shabwa. Around 130 people have been displaced, 25 houses flooded and hundreds of livestock have been killed by flood events in Hadhramaut. The authorities deployed emergency teams to rescue people trapped in valleys by the floodings. ([ECHO, 5 Jun 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3641491))

Since the past week, heavy rain has been affecting western Yemen (particularly Al-Hodeidah, Ibb, Hajjah, Lahj, Shabwah, Abyan, and Sana'a Governorates), triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. Media reports, as of 28 July, 17 fatalities (of which 13 across Al-Hodeidah, 3 in Hajjah and one across Ibb). In addition, more than 50 houses were destroyed across the aforementioned Governorates. Over the next 24 hours, more heavy rain is forecast over western and central Governorates, with locally very heavy rain over the already affected ones.

Egypt: Floods - Mar 2020,"On 11 March 2020, the Egyptian Red Crescent issued an emergency alert and activated its Central Emergency Operations Center (EOC) as well as the Emergency Operations Rooms at the Branches. The continued severe weather, including heavy rain, strong winds and thunderstorms caused widespread flooding across Egypt, killing at least 40 people. According to Ministry of Social Solidarity (MoSS), 10 people died and more than 400 injured in Cairo, 3 people died and 5 were injured in Qena Governorate (central Egypt). The remaining fatalities occurred in Giza, Ismailia, Sharkeia, New Valley, Menofia, and South Sinai Governorates, 12 people missing. The train service was suspended nationwide, as heavy rain caused a train collision in northern Giza, injuring 13 people. The official figures reported by the MoSS on the number of people affected by the floods in the country estimates 20,000 people (4,000 families).

Iran: Locust Infestation - Mar 2020,"In late February, there were 22 reports of moderate to high-density immature swarms in coastal areas in Khuzestan, Bushehr, southern Fars and western Hormozgan provinces. Limited local breeding has occurred on the south-east coast in Hormozgan province. Last year, desert locusts resulted in major losses on over 500,000 hectares of farmlands and gardens. The number of locust swarms this year is predicted to reach seven-fold that of last year. As a result, controlling activities will continue until June at a large scale targeting up to a million hectares of agricultural lands in 10 southern and south-western provinces of the country.  ([OCHA, 10 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3557838/)) 

Desert Locust invaded Iran in late February 2020 and quickly spread to four southern provinces of western Hormozgan, Boushehr, Khouzestan, and southern Fars, where the adults rapidly matured and laid eggs in areas that had received good rains. This breeding will cause a substantial increase in locust numbers once eggs hatch in March, hoppers form bands in April and a new generation of swarms form by the end of May. The southern provinces (along the Persian Gulf) have a very suitable condition for spring breeding and if not effectively managed, two generations could occur, giving rise to a 400-fold increase in locust numbers before the summer. ([FAO, 24 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3576483/))     

Six provinces in southern Iran have been infected by swarms of desert locust in an area of around 45,000 hectares of land. Hatchings in southern provinces are expected to increase to the great amount before the summer if not effectively managed. For instance, it is forecasted the number of hatchings in Boushehr province could reach up to 800 billion from 2 billion as of 15 March. ([OCHA, 31 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3585798/))    

Desert Locust has affected more than 54,600 hectares of land in six provinces: Hormozgan, Sistan and Baluchistan, Khuzestan, Fars, Bushehr, and [southern parts of] Kerman. According to the recent trend of breeding, hatchings and forming of the desert locust, a wider area of land on the Persian Gulf, Hormozgan coast, and the south-western and south-eastern coasts will be further affected if not effectively managed. The wave of the desert locust has damaged agricultural lands, threatening agricultural-based livelihoods and food security. At least, $ 4 million is required to continue to combat the desert locust with pesticides until this August. ([OCHA, 8 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3596434/))

As of 28 April, the number of provinces that are severely affected by the desert locust has increased from six to seven as a result of the recent detection of desert locust in South Khorasan Province. The Ministry of Agriculture Jihad has continued its spraying operations in the locust-infested provinces. Despite all the measures taken, it is predicted that a new wave of locust would invade the country, primarily affecting the southern provinces of Bushehr, Hormozgan and Sistan and Baluchistan, for the next 10 days. ([OCHA, 28 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3623859/))

As of 28 May, in southern Sistan and Baluchistan Province, in total 5,500 hectares of pastures and agricultural lands has been damaged by the migrating desert locust. In Razavi Khorasan Province, 1,390 hectares of agricultural lands has been newly infested by desert locusts. In Sistan and Baluchistan Province, 34 combat teams and 44 monitoring teams were deployed, and nearly 127,000 hectares of pastures have been sprayed as of 26 May. In Fars Province, operations against desert locusts is underway in 28,000 hectares of agricultural lands in 11 cities. The operations engage the local farmers and
gardeners. As a part of the operation, nearly 150 farmers have received more than 280 litres of pesticides. In Kerman Province, a total of 23,000 hectares has been sprayed as of 26 May. ([OCHA, 28 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3638957/))

South Asia: Locust Infestation - Feb 2020,"In **Pakistan**, ground control operations continue in spring breeding areas of Baluchistan against hopper groups in the interior (Dalbandin) and near the coast in Turbat, Gwadar and Lasbela. Similar operations are in progress against hoppper and adult groups in a few summer areas of Nara and Cholistan deserts. Teams treated 4 625 ha on 1-15 June. Adult groups will move from Baluchistan to the summer breeding areas along the Indo-Pakistan border where more hatching and the formation of hopper groups will occur. ([FAO, 20 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3180634/))

In Pakistan, ground control operations (4 000 ha) are underway against groups of mature adults that are laying in adjacent areas of Tharparkar and Cholistan deserts. Hatching and band formation will occur during the remainder of July. A second generation of breeding could start as soon as mid-August south of Rohri near the Indus Valley in Pakistan where early breeding occurred in May. The scale and extent of the summer breeding will depend on this year's monsoon rains, which are so far about two weeks late in arriving to the breeding areas along both sides of the border. ([FAO, 16 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3217493/))

According to initial estimates by the Chamber of Agriculture, as much as 40 percent of crops in the country have been destroyed. This includes food crops such as wheat and vegetables and commodity crops such as cotton. The extended monsoon season has provided conditions that have allowed the locusts to continue breeding and surviving for longer in the Indo-Pakistan border region. Food insecurity is already high in the country, with over 3 million people in IPC Phases 3 and 4, particularly in Balochistan and Sindh provinces. Damage to crops at this magnitude is not only a threat to food security in the affected communities, but also poses a challenge for livelihoods as many rural farmers use the money from selling crops to pay off debt and survive financially during the off season. ([ACAPS, 21 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3405428/))

In South-West Asia, locust infestations are declining along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border due to control operations, drying conditions and swarm migration towards the west. So far this month, Pakistan has treated more than 20 000 ha. Adult groups and swarms are expected to arrive in southwest Pakistan and southeast Iran during the next few weeks. Some swarms may continue moving west along the southern coast of Iran to areas of recent good rains. If temperatures remain warm, egg-laying could occur now, giving rise to hopper groups and bands in January; otherwise, breeding will commence in about February or March. Both countries are advised to be extremely vigilant in all areas and undertake regular surveys, supplemented by control operations whenever necessary. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3446578/))

On 1 February, the government of Pakistan declared a national emergency over locust swarms, which have been destroying crops in Punjab region. The Ministry of National Food Security and Research and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) endorsed a $500,000 Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) to make FAO’s technical expertise available to national experts in order to strengthen their capacities to combat the Desert Locust infestation and improve locust management. ([FAO, 16 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3524904/))

Mature adult groups and swarmlets were seen copulating in Okara district of Punjab and Dera Ismail Khan and Lucky Marwat districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Spring breeding is in progress in the interior of Baluchistan between Khuzdar and Dalbandin, and on the southwest coast near Turbat where adult groups are laying eggs and early instar hopper groups are already forming. Ground teams treated 4 490 ha (18-29 Feb). New generation immature groups and swarms could start forming in Baluchistan by the end of March. ([FAO, 3 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3548318/))

As of 12 March, twenty one districts of Blochistan, Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provinces have been under the threat of desert locust infestation. The government has devised a national action plan for Desert Locust Control and Surveillance. Under the national action plan, districts committees are formed for coordination. 173 teams have been deployed across Pakistan in affected areas for surveillance and control of locust. FAO is providing technical, material and logistics support to the Ministry of Food Security. ([OCHA, 12 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3572528/))

A severe locust infestation is likely to affect domestic food production and vulnerable agropastoral populations. In North West Pakistan (former FATA), 1.27 million people are expected to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) by August 2020 ([FSIN, 20 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3612544/)).

As of 26 April, overall 124,299 sq.km area has been surveyed in vulnerable areas, and 8,843 square kilometers have been treated. During the next few weeks, spring breeding will continue in coastal and interior areas of Baluchistan and an increasing number of hoppers will become adults and form groups as well as perhaps a few small swarms. There is no major presence of locust in Sindh, only some in Ghotki, near the border. This year the situation is aggravated as for the first time in many decades, there is a second threat of invasion by swarms in East Africa in late June and during July ([FAO, 4 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3631366/)).

As of 13 May, new swarms from current breeding will form from mid-June onwards, coinciding with the start of the harvest. At this time, there is a risk that swarms will migrate to the summer breeding areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border. In Pakistan, adult groups are migrating to the Indian border from breeding areas in Baluchistan and the Indus Valley where hopper groups are present as well as in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Control operations are underway in all affected provinces of Pakistan. ([Govt. of Pakistan,13 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3635024))

In Pakistan, desert locust breeding is ongoing across 38 percent of land area (60 percent in Balochistan, 25 percent in Sindh and 15 percent in Punjab), with the entire country under threat of an invasion if the pest is not contained. The country currently has over 3 million people in severe acute food insecurity. Further damage to crops at this magnitude poses a challenge for livelihood resilience. On May 22, FAO has launched humanitarian response plan to provide livelihood support for 19,500 households affected by the crisis ([FAO,22 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3637289)). 

[Three] Indian States of Madhya Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (UP) are currently dealing with locusts attack. This is the second round of locust attack in **India** after the December-February period. As per media reports, 17 districts of UP, 16 districts of Rajasthan and 12 districts of MP have been affected, with the standing crops having been destroyed. In Rajasthan, during the past weeks, small swarms of desert locusts, had already arrived from Pakistan, moving east into Rajasthan, and reaching Jodhpur. Agricultural departments of the affected states are launching initiatives to deal with the crisis. Locusts attacks in India usually last until November but this year the swarms stayed until February which scientists believe was due to the climate crisis. India has proposed a trilateral response in partnership with Pakistan and Iran to combat the desert locust wave sweeping across the Afro-Asian region. ([ECHO, 25 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3637976/))    

As of 26 May, an estimated 1.5 million people have been affected by swarms of desert locusts since January 2020 in what is being called the worst locust outbreak in **Pakistan** in over 25 years. Pakistan is an important front-line country for desert locusts as it lies on their migratory route and because it covers both summer and winter/spring breeding areas. The existing situation in Pakistan is far worse than initially anticipated, affecting significant areas of food crops, orchards, and fodder, with negative consequences on food security, nutrition, and livelihoods across all provinces. The ongoing response to eradicate and control the locust swarms is being led by the Government with the support of the international community ([OCHA, 26 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3638125/)).

In **Pakistan**, the National Locust Control Centre (NLCC) of National Disaster Management Authority announced on 7 June that an area of 5,245 square kilometers had been cleared from desert locusts in the affected areas of 46 districts in Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan, while a survey on 260,785 sq km has been completed. The NLCC bulletin indicated that additional adult groups and swarms would form in Balochistan, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and move to Cholistan, Nara and Tharparkar along the India-Pakistan border where they would mature and lay eggs with the onset of monsoon rains. This will be supplemented by other spring-bred swarms arriving from Iran during June and East Africa from early July onwards. Locusts that arrive in advance of the rains are likely to settle in cropping areas or continue east to India ([Dawn, 8 Jun 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3641936/)).

As of 11 June, according to details released by the National Locust Control Center (NLCC), anti-locust operations have been carried out in an area of 5,668 square kilometers approximately 1.4 million hectares across 51 affected districts of the country. ([OCHA, 11 June 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3643354/)).

The Government of Pakistan’s preliminary estimate of monetary losses due to desert locusts over the two coming agricultural seasons in 2020 and 2021 may range from US$3.4 billion to $10.21 billion. Locust damage has significantly affected many farmers already, with further significant locust damage forecast at the end of summer. More than 3 million people in Pakistan are facing severe acute food insecurity, with the situation particularly precarious in Balochistan. It is estimated that approximately 34,000 households will need of emergency livelihood and food-security assistance due to crop losses. Many more people may be indirectly affected by crop losses leading to price rises in key commodities. ([OCHA, 15 June 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3644428/)).

Locust infestations in Southwest **Pakistan** are seeing a decline as a result of control operations and migration of locusts swarms to summer breeding areas along the Indo-Pakistan border. In Western Rajasthan, **India**, the locusts swarm is moving back and forth at the border area to Pakistan. However, the lack of monsoon rain is favouring the movement of the spring-bred adult swarms further east into several states of northern India. With the onset of the monsoon rain the swarms are likely to return to Rajasthan to breed. Pakistan and India are expected to continue facing challenges with the beginning of summer breeding in July. To prevent desert locusts upsurges, FAO conducts monitoring, early warning and control operations in both countries ([OCHA, 23 June 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3646538/)).

As of 1 Jul, locust swarms have already started laying eggs in Nagarparkar in Sindh near India Border. Locust swarms are also present in the Indus valley and started to form hopper bands in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. WFP and FAO are jointly launching assessment in locust affected districts across the country to assess the scale of losses and determine the livelihood recovery needs of the targeted communities ([OCHA, 1 Jul 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3649661/)).

Risk of swarm migration from Horn of Africa to Indo-Pakistan increases. New reports of Desert Locust swarms further east in northern Somalia suggest that migration from northeast Somalia across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border could be imminent. Summer breeding has commenced along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border where numerous swarms are present mainly in Rajasthan, India. Hatching and band formation will increase during this month in Rajasthan and northern Gujarat, India as well as adjacent areas of Tharparkar, Nara and Cholistan deserts in Pakistan. A few swarms continue to be seen further east in Uttar Pradesh, India and at least one swarmlet reached the central plains of Nepal on 12 July where they are likely to disperse or return towards Rajasthan without causing significant damage or breeding. A few residual populations remain in the spring breeding areas of southeast Iran and southwest Pakistan. ([FAO, 13 Jul 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3652539/))

Desert Locust swarms continue to persist along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border. In **Pakistan**, control operations continue against hopper groups and bands in southeast Sindh near Nagarparkar and the India border. Low numbers of adults are present in Cholistan and Lasbela where breeding will occur. In **India**, only a few spring-breed adult groups and swarms remain in northern Rajasthan as most of the first-generation laying has finished. As a result, widespread hatching and the formation of hopper groups and bands is underway. Control operations continue. ([FAO, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659882/))

The risk of swarm migration to the Indo-Pakistan summer breeding area has nearly subsided. Good progress is being made against the first generation of hopper groups and bands that have formed mainly in Rajasthan, India and to a lesser degree in Tharparkar district in southern Sindh, Pakistan. This was the result of more than 1,000 teams, 750 vehicles and nearly 6,000 staff involved in the ground control campaign in Pakistan and hundreds of teams in India. ([FAO, 24 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3664352/))

The extensive hatching and hopper band formation occurred in India and, on a smaller scale, in southeast Pakistan. Intensive control operations significantly reduced the infestations that will limit a second generation of breeding in September. It is foretasted that the hoppers will form adult groups and smaller swarm along Indo-Pakistan border that will mature and lay eggs, causing a second but smaller generation of hopper bands in October. ([FAO, 2 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3667034/))

In **India**, during May-June 2020, Government of Rajasthan reported crop damage of 33% and more due to locust attack in 2235 hectare area in Bikaner, 140 hectare in Hanumangarh, and 1027 hectare area in Sri Ganganagar. However, as per revised report, it has been stated that earlier submitted data was related to initial stage of crop sown in Kharif season and this area of crop loss has been re-sown by farmers. State Governments of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have reported crop damage of less than 33% in 6520 ha, 4400 ha, 806 ha, 488 ha and 267 ha respectively due to locust attack this year. State Government of Rajasthan has reported that a relief of Rs. 132.54 crores have been paid to 79,922 farmers due to locust attack from State Disaster Response Fund in the form of Agriculture input subsidy. State Government of Gujarat has reported that a total amount of approximately Rs. 18.74 crore has been paid to 9137 farmers as agricultural input subsidy from the State Disaster Response Fund. ([Govt. of India, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671685/))

During September, the situation improved dramatically in **Pakistan**. In Sidh, a very limited second generation of breeding occurred west of Hyderabad, and in Tharparkar south of Chachro where early instar hopper groups were present at a few places. In Cholistan, groups of immature adults were present south of Bahawalpur, and near Islamgarh. In the Lasbela Valley, several hopper groups and bands were present south of Uthal that gave rise to two small immature swarms during the last decade of the month. Ground teams treated 3,645 ha. No locusts were seen elsewhere in Punjab, KPK, Sindh, and on the coast of Baluchistan. Locust numbers will continue to decline in all areas. A few small residual infestations may persist in Lasbela. No significant development are likely. In **India**, by early September, the situation had improved dramatically, and no locusts were seen during intensive surveys in Rajasthan and Gujarat throughout the month. Small residual populations of scattered adults may be present in a few places in Rajasthan. No significant developments are likely. ([FAO, 5 Oct 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3675883/))

During October, in **Pakistan**, a few mid-instar hopper groups were seen in Tharparkar south of Chachro, and along the Indus River near Hyderabad at the beginning of the month. Scattered immature solitarious adults mixed with a few mature adults were present in Cholistan near near Islamgarh. In the Lasbela Valley, a few immature adult groups were seen south of Uthal on the 17th. Ground teams treated 220 ha. No locusts were seen elsewhere in Punjab, KP, Sindh, and in Baluchistan on the coast and in eastern interior. Locust numbers will continue to decline in summer breeding areas. A few small residual infestations may persist in Lasbela, and low numbers of adult may appear in Baluchistan. No significant developments are likely. In **India**, no locusts were seen during surveys in Rajastan and Gujarat. ([FAO, 2 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3684309/))

On 24 January 2020, the Ministry of Health and Population declared a national measles epidemic. Subsequently, a response plan and a resource mobilization strategy were developed with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and non-governmental organizations. The main action adopted in the response plan consisted of a national vaccination campaign targeting 2.65 million children aged between 6 months and 10 years, with an emphasis on the children aged 6 months up to 5 years, given their particular vulnerability. Due to the limited availability of vaccines and medical equipment, a difficulty which was further amplified by COVID-19, the vaccination campaign was planned in two phases: a first phase in February and March covered the 13 most affected health districts and a second phase followed in August in the remaining 22 health districts. After an initial phase between January and March, where measles cases continued to increase, a decrease was observed in
the 13 health districts that had already implemented the immunization campaign. In September, a considerable drop in suspected cases was noted with less than 50 new infections per week in the last two weeks of the month. ([OCHA, 8 Dec 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3695170))

The government raised the alert status to Level 3 after the volcano spewed ash in a phreatic eruption. Residents from at least three municipalities of the province of Batangas were evacuated. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Manila put on hold all departing and arriving flights due to ash fall. ([ECHO, 12 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3471948))

On 12 January, alert level-4 (hazardous eruption imminent) was raised over Taal Volcano located in the CALABARZON region 70 km south of the capital Manila. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) raised the alert level a few hours after it raised the alert to level-3 on the evening of 12 January. According to PHIVOLCS, Taal Volcano entered a period of unrest beginning with phreatic or steam-driven activity in several points inside the main crater that then progressed into a magmatic eruption at 2:49 a.m. local time on 13 January. This magmatic eruption is characterized by weak lava fountaining accompanied by thunder and flashes of lightning. Seismic activity was also recorded in Tagaytay City, Cabuyao, Laguna, Talisay, Alitagtag, Lemery and Bauan, Batangas, with over 75 volcanic earthquakes felt at an intensity ranging from II to V as of 5 a,m. that morning. These developments signify likely continuous magmatic intrusion beneath the volcano, which may lead to further eruptive activity. ([OCHA, 13 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3472528))

Around 39,020 are still taking temporary shelter in almost 90 evacuation centers, while approximately 99,980 are estimated to be staying with friends and/or family. Approximately 47,610 houses suffered damaged from the earthquake, and as such, more than ₱30,722,190 worth of assistance was provided by DSWD to affected families. ([Govt. of the Philippines, 13 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3474033)).

Six months after a series of earthquake struck several municipalities, more than 277,000 people remain displaced in North Cotabato and Davao del Sur.  According to evacuation centres managers, 47 per cent of these displace people are not able to observe physical distancing inside shelters due lack of space. There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in evacuation centres yet, but many displaced people do not report symptoms for fear of being isolated. Food security and livelihoods are heavily affected by movement restrictions as displaced people working as farmers have difficulties transporting and selling their produce on local markets, while labourers and construction workers who rely on public transportation are currently unable to go to work ([OCHA, 12 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633780)).

Tropical Cyclone Pawan - Dec 2019,"The Tropical Storm (TS) initially named SIX that developed in the northern Indian Ocean has now been assigned the name PAWAN after sustaining a speed of more than 39 miles per hour for two days. The probability of the TS landing in the coastal areas of Puntland has increased from (10% TO 35%) over the last two days and is expected to make a land fall in Nugaal region in the next 24 hours.The influence of PAWAN may start being felt in the coastal areas of Bari, Mudug and Sanaag regions in the next 12 hours where moderate to heavy rains and strong winds are expected. The rains will then spread further inland to many areas within Somaliland, Puntland and central regions on 07 and 08 December 2019. ([FAO, 6 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3427818))

As Pawan turns and tracks towards Somalia, it is expected that the strength will intensify. Under the current conditions, Pawan is expected to make landfall within the next 30 hours and based on the current trajectory, the cyclone will make landfall in Puntland and some parts of Somaliland, namely Awdal and Sannag regions. Strong winds, storm surges and heavy rainfall are expected to cause flooding and trigger landslides, resulting in casualties, as well as damages to crops livelihoods, livestock, infrastructure and housing. Based on the current trajectory, the tropical cyclone could make landfall affecting the Bosaso IDP Camp in Bari Region of Puntland. The total population of the three provinces most likely to be affected is 2.3 million, however it is difficult to estimate the proportion that live on the coast, as some 65% of the population are nomadic.

The funding provides 88 Swiss francs (90.6 US dollars) cash each for 1,000 vulnerable herder families to prevent the starvation, dehydration and cold exposure of their livestock because of poor access to feed, water, veterinary care and shelter. A livestock nutrition kit will support livestock health during winter's lean months. ([IFRC, 9 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3468203))

As stated by National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring (NAMEM) on 12 January, over 70 percent of the country is covered by 10-30cm thick layer of snow. The joint assessment team of NEMA and MOFALI have reported that the Arkhangai, Bulgan, Govi-Altai, Dundgovi, Uvurkhangai, Sukhbaatar, Khovd, Khentii and Zavkhan provinces are experiencing severe winter as the local hay and fodder reserves have been completely consumed at soum level. Recognising their vulnerability, the Government of Mongolia allocated funding of 1.7 billion tugriks to provinces with a higher risk of being affected by dzud in December 2019. Among the recipients, 50 million tugriks have been allocated to the Uvurkhangai, Arkhangai, Dundogovi, Tuv, Bulgan, Zavkhan, Khuvsgul provinces, where most herders migrate or go on otor, and 40.3 million tugriks worth of medical and nutritional items have been allocated for the Uvurkhangai, Dundgovi, Tuv, Zavkhan and Khuvsgul provinces. UNICEF Mongolia is also piloting a cash transfer program for children aged 0-5 years living in various soums in the Zavkhan province. ([IFRC, 23 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3489763)).

The Mongolian National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring (NAMEM) has developed an extreme winter (dzud) risk map for the country using MODIS satellite data, among other resources. The map indicates that over 50 per cent of the territory is identified with severe winter risk, while 25 per cent of the area is in mid-risk. Eight provinces have over 20 per cent of very high-risk coverage in the territory. The Mongolian dzud has severe impacts on the agricultural sector which, because of the harsh weather, remains heavily focused on nomadic animal husbandry that directly supports about a quarter of people and is the only source of income for herders. Continuous harsh conditions put at risk millions of livestock, which are the only source of food, transport and income for almost half the population of Mongolia, leaving thousands of families in hardship and forcing them to move to rural areas or outside the country.

Somalia: Floods - Oct 2019,"Moderate to heavy rains continued in many parts of Somalia and within the Ethiopian highlands over the last one week. River levels at Belet Weyne (Shabelle) are currently very high and the trend is expected to continue reaching over bank in the coming few days. Along Juba, the river levels are also high. The cumulative rainfall forecast for the coming week is calling for moderate to heavy rains across the country as well as the Ethiopian highlands. The river levels will therefore continue to rise with a high risk of flooding along the entire two channels. Flash floods are expected in built-up and low lying areas of Bay, Bakool and central regions given the forecast. ([FAO, 18 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3354633))

As of 22 November 2019, an estimated 112 175 people have been affected by the floods, including 60 000 in Likouala (53%), 33 933 in Cuvette (30%), 16 100 in Plateaux (14%) and 2 142 (2%) in Shanga. Refugees constitute one-quarter (26%, n=29 183) of the affected population. ([WHO, 1 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3420943))

Since October 2019, heavy rains have affected at least 170,000 people in the three most affected departments alone, including 30,000 Central African and Congolese refugees. ([OCHA, 10 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3433368))

A rapid humanitarian assessment led by the Government and the United Nations took place from 14 to 18 December 2019. More than one month after the start of the floods, water continues to be present in many districts, with some villages still completely flooded. The most urgent needs are water, health, sanitation, shelter, food and essential nonfood items. Further damage is expected as forecasts still indicate potential heavy rains in the coming weeks. ([OCHA, 06 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3466903))

During the week of 7 January, heavy rains resulted in additional damage in the capital of the Republic of Congo, with major infrastructure collapsing and people using boats to travel the streets. ([IFRC, 17 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3481098))

Since October 2019, heavy rains have affected about 170,000 people across the country, including 30,000 Central African and Congolese refugees.
6,302 hectares of agricultural fields have been destroyed. A gradual decrease in water levels in some areas of Likouala has been observed in January 2020. The rains continue to fall in the departments below the Equator, leading to fears of an increase in flooded areas (Cuvette, Plateaux) over time, leading to population displacements and a risk of the development of waterborne diseases.

Horn of Africa: Locust Infestation - Oct 2019,"A Desert Locust infestation has been ravaging crop and pasture-land, as well as trees and other vegetation since June 2019 in parts of Afar, Amhara, Somali and Tigray regions. The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    

The Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))

Despite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))

**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))

The current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.  ([FAO, 06 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464613))

The unusually heavy rains that have impacted Eastern Africa since October 2019—driven by the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole since 2016—have contributed to a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak, according to FAO and IGAD*. **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Somalia** and **Sudan** have been affected, with the outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia the worst in 25 years, and in Kenya the worst in 75 years. There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))

The Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))

The situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))

Desert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))

Across the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))

Important and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))

According to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))

In **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

Cameroon/Chad: Floods - Oct 2019,"On 1 October, the Logone River overflowed, flooding a valley in Zina district, located within Logone-et-Chari department of Far North region. According to one source, flooding restricted access to several villages within the valley, although the exact name or number of villages is not confirmed. Populations within the commune of Zina have been forced to leave villages, although the scale of displacement from the floods is not clear. The flooding impacts will likely be aggravated by the ongoing conflict in the region, high levels of food insecurity, and the degree of poverty in Far North, one of the poorest regions of Cameroon. The floods are expected to have the greatest impact on poor households and people who have been displaced, both by the current floods and from previous displacements; Far North region has over 480,000 IDPs, returnees, and refugees.

Across 3 cities, approximately 50,000 people have been evacuated, including 20,000 who have lost their homes. Crops and public infrastructure, such as roads and WASH facilities, have all been affected. Access is constrained as responders must rely on boats to reach communities in need. A number of health centers are no longer functional and over 40 schools have been closed. Short-term needs are the provision of shelter, health care, hygiene, and clean drinking water. The damage to crops from the floods is expected to have a longer term impact on the harvests, which may lead to further food insecurity in the region.

Philippines/Malaysia: Polio Outbreak - Sep 2019,"**Malaysia**

On 8 December, the Ministry of Health of Malaysia announced a case of polio in Tuaran District in Sabah state, Malaysia. Testing has confirmed that the virus is genetically linked to poliovirus currently circulating in the southern Philippines. The patient, a 3-month-old male child, developed fever and paralysis on 26 October. On 6 December, testing conducted by the World Health Organization’s Regional Polio Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, confirmed that poliovirus is the cause of the child’s illness. The last case of this highly infectious disease in Malaysia was in 1992. ([WHO & UN Children's Fund, 9 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3434588)).

As of 15 January, there are three cVDPV1 confirmed cases from Sabah State, Malaysia. All of them are genetically linked to the Basilan case. With three cVDPV1 cases from Malaysia confirmed to be related to the one Philippine cVDPV1 case, the regional risk of potential spread across international borders remains moderate, especially considering the large number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) and the ease of travel between islands without any form of control, especially by traders from Mindanao. ([UNICEF/WHO, 15 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3476018/))

On 14 September 2019, VDPV2 was confirmed in one three-year-old child with Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) symptoms, from Lanao del Sur (Mindanao). The isolated VDPV2 was found to be genetically linked to the 2 confirmed VDPV2 environmental samples. As a result, VDPV2 was classified as circulating (cVDPV2). On 19 September 2019, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the re-emergence of polio in the Philippines and declared a national polio outbreak, in line with International Health Regulations (IHR). Synchronized polio vaccination conducted in Manila in response to the 1st confirmed VDPV1 samples only reached 53.8% of the target number of children aged 0 to 59 months. ([WHO/UNICEF, 19 Sep 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3311053)) 

On 19 September, the second VDPV2 case was confirmed in a 5-year-old boy from Laguna Province, approximately 100 km south-east of Metro Manila. Investigations and further characterization of the virus are ongoing. In addition, VDPV1 has also been isolated from environmental samples collected on 1 July, 22 July, 13 August, and 27 August from Manila. WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread from the Philippines to be low. However, the risk of further spread within the Philippines is high due to limited population immunity (coverage of bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was at 66% and 41% respectively in 2018) and suboptimal AFP surveillance. ([WHO, 24 Sep 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3319913))

The re-emergence of the disease comes almost 20 years since the Philippines was declared polio-free in 2000. The last known case of wild poliovirus recorded in the Philippines was in 1993. ([IFRC, 28 Sep 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3329968))

Enhanced routine immunization with 3 doses of bOPV as well as inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) nationwide is ongoing. ([WHO/UNICEF, 9 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3339148))

Synchronized polio vaccination campaigns began on 14 October in National Capital Region (NCR), Davao City, Davao del Sur, and Lanao del Sur, including Marawi City. The current campaign in NCR aims to vaccinate almost 1.3 million children under five and over 400,000 in Mindanao between 14-27 October. No further cases have been confirmed. The current polio outbreak figures were derived from nine confirmed environmental samples and two human cases, resulting from persistently low routine immunization coverage, and poor sanitation and hygiene. ([WHO/UNICEF, 17 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3352443))

In Mindanao, one 4-year old child from Datu Piang, Maguindanao, Mindanao was confirmed with VDPV type 2 on 24 October 2019. This is a newly infected province and represents an expansion of the outbreak in Mindanao. This is the second human case categorised as positive for cVDPV2, as the case from Laguna is categorized as positive for immunodeficiency-related VDPV (iVDPV2). A third child from Maguindano residing in Datu Paglas was confirmed testing positive for VDPV2 on 25 October. This brings the total of cVDPV2 cases to three. ([WHO & UNICEF, 25 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3364448))

As of 9 November, a fourth confirmed polio case has been confirmed in a three-year old female from Lambayong in Sultan Kudarat province (Mindanao), who had not received any dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). On 4 November, stool samples sent to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan tested positive for VDPV2. This is the third human case categorised as positive for cVDPV2: all polio viruses isolated are genetically linked.

Papua New Guinea: Mt. Ulawun Volcano - Jun 2019,"On 26 June, the Ulawun volcano in East New Britain erupted and began emitting ash plumes up to 20,000 metres. About 12,000 people in West New Britain and 4,000 people in East New Britain have been affected by the eruption. About 6,800 people have evacuated and are in two care centres in West New Britain.The West New Britain provincial authorities are assessing the affected area. The volcanic activity is subsiding, and the alert level is expected to be lowered from level 2 to 1. ([Office of the Resident Coordinator, 27 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3190214))      

Between 3,000 and 5,000 people voluntarily evacuated the immediate vicinity of Ulawun, according to the National Disaster Centre. The ash plume is moving generally south but has slowed in recent hours. Air Niugini has cancelled flights to Hoskins Airport until further assessments are made. The cluster system is to be activated in response to food, water, shelter and non food item needs among the evacuees. As the area has been cut off from the highway, relief items will be transported by road from Kimbe to Bialla, and then via helicopter to those affected. ([ECHO, 27 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3190239))    

Approximately 10,620 people have congregated in at least ten care centre sites, according to local-level government authorities in Bialla, West New Britain. Another 427 people are in a single care centre in East New Britain. No casualties have been reported. Ashfall has been observed across Talesea District, and down to Kimbe. The authorities in West New Britain have declared a provincial state of emergency and have activated their emergency response plan for Mt. Ulawun, including the establishment of a forward base in Bialla. All communities within a 20-kilometre radius of the volcano were instructed to relocate to designated safe zones. Hoskins airport was opened at 17:00 today by the airport authority, National Airports Corporation. It is expected that Air Niugini flights will resume over the weekend pending and air quality assessment. ([Office of the Resident Coordinator, 28 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3192074))

As of 2 July, approximately 13,250 people have congregated in at least 9 care centre sites in West New Britain. Two people have been reportedly sustained light injuries during the relocation. Overcrowding has been observed in the care centre sites. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a large number of people are staying in open areas without shelter, minimal food supplies, with limited access to clean drinking water, latrines, and sanitation.There are public health risks of vector-borne diseases, measles, and other vaccine-preventable and diarrhoeal diseases. Due to heavy ashfall remaining on the runway, Air Niugini flights into Hoskins Airport were cancelled again as of 1 July until a further review is undertaken by the airline.([Office of the Resident Coordinator, 2 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3196329/))

The alert level remains at 1, indicating a low threat to life. West New Britain provincial authorities have downgraded the State of Emergency on 12 July, noting that it would be scaling down operations and officers would be returning to their normal duties. Gaps remain in addressing evacuees’ needs at care centres, apart from food. A major concern remains the risk of disease outbreaks due to a lack of access to water, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, and general living conditions at the care centres and other evacuation sites. ([Office of the Resident Coordinator, 12 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3211979))

A government assessment of communities home to approximately 7,500 people, showed nearly all household food gardens were covered in ash and likely lost. Schools, due to resume on 8 July, remained suspended. Evacuees are still located in informal sites along the Pandi River.

Pakistan: Polio Outbreak - May 2019,"The Committee is gravely concerned by the significant further increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2019, particularly in Pakistan where 15 cases have already been reported. In Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by the number of positive environmental isolates in many areas of the country, and the proportion of samples that detect WPV1 is rising. The recent cluster of cases in Lahore also indicates that vulnerabilities still exist outside the high-risk corridors. Notably, the increased rate of infection during what is usually the low season may herald even higher rates of infection in the coming high season unless urgent remedial steps are taken. The committee was very concerned about attacks on vaccinators and on the police protecting them. The increasing refusal by individuals and communities to accept vaccination also needs to be actively addressed. While the committee understood that the recent elections and political transition may have adversely affected delivery of the polio program, it is now essential that the new government renews its efforts, noting that the eradication program in the country is no longer on-track. The committee suggested a thorough analysis of the situation in Pakistan be urgently undertaken, to understand what factors have led to the recent but most serious deterioration in polio eradication seen since 2014. Government, program and community factors need to be all included in such a review.

Indonesia: Floods and Landslides in Papua Province - Mar 2019,"Due to heavy rains since 16 March 2018 at 17:00hrs on the mountain, landslides hit the riverbed around Sentani causing flash floods with logs and sedimentary rocks that were channeled to the downstream. Nine villages in Sentani sub-district, Jayapura regency were affected. According to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spoke person from the National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure or Badan Nasional Penganggulangan Bencana (BNPB), during eight hours of rains, the rainfall reached its extreme condition up to 235.1 mm/hour.

There is an indication that landslide occurred in Cyclop Mountain which is the upstream area. Cyclop mountain is one of the conservation mountains in Papua. According to the information provided by BNPB and Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency that was compiled and circulated via e-mail by UNOCHA; as well as information from PMI, on Sunday, 17 March 2019, the flash flood affected nine sub districts in Jayapura regency, and four sub-districts in Jayapura city.

Tropical Cyclone Idai - Mar 2019,"Flooding in **Malawi** and **Mozambique** had affected nearly 843,000 people and caused at least 60 deaths as of 11 March, according to preliminary reports from the respective Governments. In Malawi, nearly 739,800 people had been impacted, according to the Government, with 45 deaths and 577 injuries recorded. More than 75,900 people were estimated to be displaced, with many ad hoc camps established and people living out in the open as their houses have been destroyed. Rapid needs assessments are ongoing in the areas hardest-hit by rains and flooding to verify initial estimates regarding the number of people affected and determine the number of people in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. 

As of 11 March, more than 103,100 people had been affected (more than 48,000 people in Zambezia, more than 51,200 in Tete and nearly 3,900 in Niassa), with 15 deaths recorded. Nearly 17,100 people are estimated to be displaced in Zambezia, Tete and Niassa, who are sheltering in 15 transit centres, and nearly 12,500 houses are reported to have been destroyed. Nearly 85,000 hectares of crops have been flooded, affecting more than 57,800 smallholder farmers. The water level was expected to rise in the next three days and may surpass the alert level in the Licungo, Zambeze, Pungoe and Buzi river basins. 

Tropical Cyclone IDAI, which formed over the Northern Mozambique Channel on 9 March, was expected to make landfall near Beira on 14 or 15 March. The cyclone was located over the Mozambique Channel on 12 March and was expected to strengthen into intense tropical cyclone status (Category 4 equivalent) again prior to making landfall. Nearly 1.6 million people were estimated to live in areas that could be impacted by high wind speeds (>120km/h), according to the latest analysis from UNOSAT. After landfall, Cyclone Idai was expected to track inland, bringing heavy rain to central Mozambique and potentially into eastern **Zimbabwe**. [OCHA, 13 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3033018/)

###Mozambique

The national meteorological authorities (INAM) issued an alert on 9 March 2019 on the Tropical Depression active in Mozambique channel that was moving towards the coastal areas of Zambézia and Sofala and was to intensify in the next 24 hours to severe Tropical storm stage (wind speed 89-118 km/h). ([UN RC for Mozambique, 10 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3028628))  The alert issued on the 10th of March indicated that it had evolved from Tropical Depression to Moderate Tropical Storm called IDAI. ([UN RC for Mozambique, 10 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3028633))  

On 11 March 2019, the Government convened the Coordinating Council of Disaster Management (CCGC) to analyze the impact of the recent floods and the foreseen cyclone. Given the current and expected situation after the floods and cyclone, INAM estimated a total funding requirement of about US$ 18 million for food and non-food items. This funding estimate does not include the funds needed for emergency road work (estimated at US$ 13.9 million) to reset the road network which is 31% damaged in Zambézia and 50% damaged in Cabo Delgado. ([UN RC for Mozambique, 12 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3032613))   

Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall during the night of 14 to 15 March 2019 near Beira City, Sofala Province, in central Mozambique. The cyclone brought torrential rains and winds to Sofala, Zambezia, Manica and Inhambane provinces. The UN and humanitarian partners in Mozambique appealed for US$40.8 million to provide critical emergency relief to 400,000 people who were estimated to be affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai, based on projections of people living in the Cyclone’s path. ([OCHA, 15 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3037298))

The extent of the damage was not yet fully known as access to Beira, a city of 500,000 people, was lost immediately after the cyclone. Roads were blocked and the airport was temporarily closed. Initial figures indicate 400,000 people have been displaced with many more affected. As of March 18, the death toll from Cyclone Idai’s landfall stands at 84 and according to media reports the President of Mozambique declared it could rise above 1,000 ([IFRC, 19 March 2019](https://reliefweb.int/ https://reliefweb.int/node/3044903/))

Outside of Beira, a dam collapsed on 17 March, reportedly causing extensive damage. People reportedly sought refuge on the tops of their roofs and trees as rising floodwaters swept through the area. Initial aerial surveys indicated significant loss of life, although exact numbers of people impacted are not yet known. ([OCHA, 18 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3040883/))

([OCHA, 6 May 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3121953/))
Two months on from Cyclone Idai's landfall on 14 March, the humanitarian response had reached more than 1.6 million people across the central region of Mozambique. Humanitarian action scaled-up rapidly, with more than 200 organisations joining the response and more than 1,000 aid workers deployed to the affected areas. However, the response remained severely under-funded, with just under 35 per cent of the required funding received. ([OCHA, 17 May 2019](https://reliefweb.int/ https://reliefweb.int/node/3139223/))

The closure of temporary accommodation sites concluded on 18 June. The latest available data, reported a total of 63 resettlement sites, hosting 14,528 households and 66,118 persons across Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezia as of 28 June; on 14 June, the number was 12,114 HH and 53,246 persons in 46 permanent sites. In light of this evolution, UNHCR continued to prioritize protection and assistance to IDPs in resettlement sites, in coordination with the Provincial Directorate of Gender, Child Protection and Social Affairs (DPGCAS) [UNHCR, 1 July 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3216283)

###Zimbabwe

Following its landfall in Mozambique on 14 March, Cyclone Idai continued across land as a Tropical Storm and hit eastern **Zimbabwe** with heavy rains and strong winds. The storm caused high winds and heavy precipitation in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts causing riverine and flash flooding and subsequent deaths, destruction of livelihoods and properties....At least 31 deaths have been reported and over 100 people are missing, according to preliminary information...At least 1,600 households (8,000 to 9,600 people) have been affected in Chimanimani, Chipinge, Nyanga and Mutare districts, Manicaland Province, as a result of flooding and landslides, according to initial information. Based on census data, 48 per cent of those affected are estimated to be children and 52 per cent are estimated to be women. In Tongogara Refugee Camp, nearly 300 people have been affected, with 49 houses damaged. Considerable damage to properties, livelihoods and infrastructure has also been reported in the districts in the storm’s path. ([OCHA, 17 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3038578/))    

The flooding caused by the Tropical Cyclone Idai weather system since 15 March...continues to cause massive destruction, with heavy rains ongoing in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces of Zimbabwe. The hardest-hit district of Chimanimani remains inaccessible as heavy rains have damaged roads and main access bridges have been washed away. At least 82 deaths and over 200 injuries have been reported, mainly in Chimanimani, and 217 people are reportedly missing. Chimanimani mortuary is reportedly full. At least 923 homes have been destroyed in Chimanimani, Mutasa, Mutare, Chipinge, Buhera, Chikomba, Gutu and Bikita districts. In Chimanimani alone, eight bridges have been destroyed. In Buhera, the Marowanyati dam has overflowed and many families are displaced...Overall, more than 2,500 households (12,500 to 15,000 people) are estimated to be affected. ([OCHA, 18 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3040663/))    

At least 181 deaths and 175 injuries have been reported and 330 people were reportedly missing in Zimbabwe as of 25 March...An estimated 270,000 people have been affected by flooding and are in need of humanitarian assistance in the seven districts—Chipinge, Chimanimani, Buhera, Bikita, Mutare, Gutu, and Chiredzi. The vast majority of people affected are in Chipinge (122,000) and Chimanimani (115,000) districts. ([OCHA, 27 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3056898/))    

The humanitarian response to cyclone-affected districts in the eastern part of the country increased as all
wards were accessible by road as of 24 April, although some only by 4X4 vehicles. Many clusters  completed or were
about to complete in-depth assessments in all affected districts, which afforded a more refined analysis of the
needs and a tailored humanitarian response in the short term, and also contributed to the medium- to long-term
recovery plan. ([OCHA, 24 April 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3097923/))

The Mi8 helicopter completed 46 rotations, transporting a total of 89.7mt of relief items on behalf of 8 partners. Helicopter cargo operations were discontinued on 27 April as all districts are now accessible by road again. All previously inaccessible schools, except one, were now accessible. The first round of the Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign ended on 27 April in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts, A total of 482 910 (102 per cent) individuals were vaccinated. A second round campaign is planned in June 2019. ([OCHA, 30 April 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3109058))

By May 6th, 40,000 textbooks were distributed to affected schools in Chimanimani and Chipinge ahead of reopening. 18 Temporary Learning Spaces were established in the worst affected schools. Screening of children under age 5 for acute malnutrition was ongoing, with 20,043 screened in April (50 per cent of the cluster target). Temporary latrines were constructed at 80 per cent of all affected schools in Chimanimani and Chipinge. Nearly 25,000 households were reached with nonfood items in affected areas, and over 10,000 individuals received shelter support. Funding being made available by the private sector was sufficient to cover about 27,500 people, i.e. most of the affected households in the district. Meanwhile the World Bank announced its intention to provide up to $75M for the cyclone-response with emphasis on early recovery. ([OCHA, 6 May  2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3117788))

The re-location of displaced people residing in schools had been completed enabling all schools to re-open on 7 May. Families were moved to serviced camp sites in Chimanimani. Transition to early recovery activities was underway – the sector assessment had been completed and the World Bank had a delegation in-country to finalize sectoral programming.  ([OCHA, 14 May  2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3129048))

As of 6 June, about 15,270 people remain displaced, most of them stay in host communities, while some shelter in collective centres and camps. A shortage of tents is delaying the opening of the third temporary camp. Nevertheless, this camp will not be enough to cover total numbers remaining in collective centres. The informal camp settlement in Kopa is a continuing concern ([OCHA, 14 May  2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3162294))

Some 224 families who were unable to return home continued to live in four camps in Cyclone Idai-affected areas. As the camps will remain over the rainy season, sanitation and bathing facilities need to be strengthened, as do protection measures, particularly to prevent gender-based violence.

Southeast Asia: Drought - 2019-2020,"**Cambodia**

Measurements taken of the Mekong River at Kampong Cham over the month of November indicate that water levels have declined steadily, starting from almost five metres down to approximately three metres. Similarly, at the station in Phnom Penh, water levels declined from around four metres to just below three metres. This places the river at the lowest levels it has been in these areas, during this period, over the past forty years. ([Mekong River Commission, 3 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3423553)).

**Indonesia**

According to National Disaster Management Organisation (BNPB), at least three provinces in Indonesia, Central Java, East Java, and Special Region of Yogyakarta were exposed to drought. As many as 100,230 people were affected. The local government together with local DMO (BPBD) have sent support by distributing around a million litres of water across the affected areas. Since the Southwest Monsoon will continue, similar condition may likely occur throughout the southern region. In addition, BNPB’s Analysis Centre for Disaster Aware Situation (Pastigana), have identified several areas which may experience no-rain condition for more than sixty days such as East Java, Bali, and East Nusa Tenggara Provinces. [(AHA Centre, 25 Jun 2019)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3185304)

As of 4 July, drought hit 12 villages in six districts in Purbalingga District, Central Java. A total of 733 families or 2,809 people were affected by the drought since the beginning of June. The Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) of Purbalingga Regency has carried out data collection and distribution of 49 clean water tanks or 245,000 liters for nine days. [(AHA Centre, 7 Jul 2019)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3205319)

As of 25 July, the National Agency for Disaster Management announced that 55 districts and cities have declared a drought emergency readiness status. This status is set to allow an accelerated response, i.e. water provision.

As of 14 August, 2,620 villages are facing drought conditions in 7 provinces, including Central Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, West Java, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara. ([OCHA, 19 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3264428))

By October, about 92 percent of the country was experiencing drought due to El Nino cycle at the end of 2018, which resulted in a drier and harsher dry season. The government predicted the situation to impact the lives of 48,491,666 people across 28 provinces. Nine provinces were severely affected by the drought: Banten, Central Java, West Java, East Java, Yogyakarta, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi and Borneo. The Government of Indonesia declared an emergency drought alert status in seven provinces: Banten, Central Java, West Java, East Java, Yogyakarta, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara. ([IFRC, 17 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3355288))

Nearly 50 million people in Indonesia may have been affected by the country’s long-running drought in 2019. About 92% of the country is currently experiencing drought due to El Nino cycle at the end of 2018, resulting in a harsher dry season. Earlier government estimates were that 48.5 million people in most of Indonesia’s provinces were affected, with emergencies declared in Banten, Central Java, West Java, East Java, Yogyakarta, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara.

**Laos**

The Mekong’s water level is now slightly less than a meter, about seven metres lower than its typical height at this time of year. ([ECHO, 23 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3226913))

Measurements taken of the Mekong River at Vientiane over the month of November indicate that water levels have not exceeded two metres, while the Pakse station recorded highs of less than 1.5 metres. This places the river at the lowest levels it has been in these areas, during this period, over the past forty years. ([Mekong River Commission, 3 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3423553)).

The impacts of drought and flooding in 2019, combined with the already low baseline levels of household resilience among vulnerable communities, indicated that an estimated 67,800 people would be food insecure beginning from March 2020. According to the household level food security assessments conducted, food insecurity was most acute among the poor households, and those dependent on upland rice cultivation. In consideration of the extensive crop losses and damage to agricultural livelihoods, the households dependant on upland rice cultivation and those without access to dry season planting are likely to require food assistance to bridge the food gap until the next main season harvest in 2020, which begins in October ([FAO, 9 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3597919)). 

**the Philippines**

Recent PAGASA's climate monitoring and analyses indicate that the unusually warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific (CEEP) which started since November 2018 is expected to become a full-blown El Nino. During the past three months, rainfall analyses showed that impacts of below normal rainfall conditions in provinces of Western Mindanao and Ilocos Norte were already experienced and are expected to continue. Five municipalities in Cotabato Province (Region XII) were affected by dry spell November 2018 to 22 January 2019. ([Govt. of the Philippines, 5 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3022153))

Drought conditions are being reported in the MIMAROPA Region, Region IX, and Region XII, BARMM and Metro Manila, where ten provinces have declared a State of Calamity according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). While PAGASA declared a weak El Niño lasting until June, agricultural regions are suffering from its worsening effects, with the Department of Agriculture (DA) reporting damage to over 13,600 ha of agricultural crops, mostly rice (81 per cent) and corn (19 per cent). Agricultural losses are estimated at PhP1.33 billion (US$25.6 million) but could run higher as the DA verifies reports from regional offices. Over 16,000 farmers and fisherfolk are affected, and some local media are reporting that the drought conditions are also starting to affect livestock, with some farm animals dying due to the lack of grass or hay for foraging.

Mindanao is the most affected region, a major food producer where poverty levels are the highest in the country and farmers and fisherfolk are already vulnerable due to repeated armed conflict and natural hazards such as heavy rain and flooding. Since January, the NDRRMC reports that the central and western Mindanao provinces are experiencing below normal rainfall conditions which is predicted to continue. Close to 72,000 families (360,000 people) are affected in the five municipalities in North Cotabato alone, sixty per cent of which are located in Pikit. With the recommendation of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, local authorities of North Cotabato have declared a State of Calamity. ([OCHA, 29 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3052988))

As of 25 April, weak El Niño (dry spell) condition continues to affect and incur agricultural losses to farmers.Thirty-nine local government units have declared a state of calamity due to a dry spell. 164,000 farmers have been affected. ([OCHA, 25 Apr 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3099878))

El Niño conditions persist in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Warmer than average sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific of at least 0.5°C was observed, since the last quarter of 2018. Recent analyses from global climate models suggest that the on-going El Niño condition will likely to continue until the June-July-August 2019 season. As of 24 May, more than one million people were affected in 9 regions. ([Govt. of the Philippines, 24 May 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3149528))

The dominance of the Southwest Monsoon in the region is expected to alleviate the impacts of El Niño in the Philippines. However, seasonal model outlooks generally tend to favour below-normal rainfall for the country. This means that while rainy season is coming to the Philippines, the amount of expected rainfall will still perform below usual. ([AHA Centre, 9 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3163029))

As of 27 June, a total of 1,810,382 people have been affected by the drought/dry spell  in Regions I, V, VI, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, CARAGA, and CA. It has also affected 247,610 farmers and caused an estimated 7,962,521,863.48 pesos worth of agricultural damages. A total of 51 local government units (LGUs) have declared a state of calamity due to the dry spell. ([Govt. of the Philippines, 27 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3191669/))

The weak El Niño which started since the last quarter of 2018 has ended based on the final advisory issued by DOST-PAGASA on 9 August 2019. The warmer than average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific Ocean has weakened and transitioned into neutral levels in July. It is expected that ENSO-neutral conditions will likely persist through the remainder of the year. ([Govt. of the Philippines, 28 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3279268/))

An ([FAO study](https://reliefweb.int/node/3643353/)) analyzed the outcome of acting early on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines between 2018 and 2019, ahead of an El Niño‑induced drought. It evaluated the effectiveness of anticipatory actions and highlighted families’ perspectives on the benefits of acting early.

**Timor-Leste**

Across Timor-Leste, more than 35 percent (210,000 ha) of cropland is currently experiencing severe to extreme drought. Lautem is also considered as having suffered a very long drought, with more than 30 days without rainfall, affecting 40,000 people in the municipality. Almost 1,000 women were assisted in December 2019 by the World Food Programme, as part of a campaign to improve nutrition in the country in light of the drought conditions. ([WFP, 31 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3485388)).

**Thailand**

The Meteorological Department of Thailand reported that the country is going to experience the worst drought in a decade, as average precipitation across large swaths of the country has fallen far short of the monthly average, particularly in the North and Northeastern as well as in the Central Plains - all of which are important crop growing regions. The water level of the Mekong river in the northeastern border province is only about 1.5 metres high, possibly the lowest level in almost 100 years. ([ECHO, 23 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3226913))

Media reports state on 18 August that the Lam Takhong Reservoir is at 40 percent of its storage capacity and that only 80 percent of the water in the Reservoir can be used. Many living near Klong Pai have been without tap water, despite living near the Reservoir. The reports also state that there is no water left in six of the 23 medium and large dams. Phra Thong Kham and Khon Buri are two districts declared disaster-stricken areas as a result of the water shortage ([Govt. of Thailand, 19 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3301633)).

Measurements taken of the Mekong River at Chiang Khan over the month of November indicate that water levels have not exceeded five metres. The Nong Khai and Mukdahan stations similarly saw water levels that did not exceed two metres. This places the river at the lowest levels it has been in these areas, during this period, over the past forty years ([Mekong River Commission, 3 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3423553)).

As of 18 December, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation ordered drought emergency measures in 54 districts in 11 provinces -- Chiang Rai, Nan, Nakhon Phanom, Maha Sarakham, Bueng Kan, Nong Khai, Buri Ram, Kalasin, Kanchanaburi, Chachoengsao and Phetchabun. The department has ordered local officials to provide people in those drought areas with water trucks, and has reached out to provincial administrations to survey water resources, both in terms of personal consumption and agricultural use. The department also announced that dams in nine provinces -- Chiang Mai, Uthai Thani, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Ratchasima, Buri Ram, Suphan Buri, Lop Buri and Chachoengsao -- have fallen to less than 30% of their total combined capacity ([Bangkok Post, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3445873)).

Many provinces of Thailand are now facing a drought disaster, which is expected to be more severe than last year. In response, the government has set up a special command center, to handle the crisis and assist affected village. The center will serve as a temporary cooperative center according to the Water Resources Act BE 2561 until the situation improves. The center will serve as a temporary cooperative center to oversee operations, situational forecasts, management, crisis warnings, and public relations. ([Govt. of Thailand, 6 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464858/)).

Following the drought emergency declared by the Government of Thailand, water distribution points and water trucks have been dispatched across almost 4,120 villages in 80 districts through the North, Northeastern, Upper Central and Western provinces. Urgent relief operations are underway to get water to drought-ravaged areas, mostly in outlying districts. Underground water will be provided from more than 520 sources throughout the country, 85 of which are situated in Maha Sarakham, where the drought is dire in many villages. In Bangkok, tap water has turned saltier in parts of the city. The saline intrusion is just one sign of dry conditions pointing to what the Thai Meteorological Department expects to be the worst drought in four decades. ([ECHO, 10 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3470458)).

The Government of Thailand has mobilised the army to combat the effects of drought in the country. The military’s disaster units will provide support, by engaging in disaster response operations, including distributing water to affected villagers, as well as drilling and developing groundwater wells, tap water system repairs, and supplying water to affected hospitals and schools. Engineer units and development military units are now constructing approximately 400 groundwater wells in more than 10 provinces severely affected by the drought. The units have deployed water pumps and 530 water tankers to deliver water to affected villagers in over 40 provinces facing water shortages, and have prepared nine aircraft to support rainmaking operations to cover all affected areas. ([Govt. of Thailand, 17 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3482198)).

The Office of National Water Resources (ONWR) has implemented measures to mitigate saltwater intrusion using water from the eastern region. The office is following up the progress of drought prevention projects and village water sources development which help increase water reserves by 134 million cubic meters. Some 70,000 houses are anticipated to benefit from the project. ([Govt. of Thailand, 30 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3500593)).

As of 11 February, twenty-one provinces in the North, Northeast and central region have been declared drought-hit areas by the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation. The provinces are Chiang Rai, Phayao, Nan, Uttaradit, Sukhothai, Phetchabun in the North; Nong Khai, Bung Kan, Nakhon Phanom, Sakon Nakhon, Kalasin, Maha Sarakham, Nakhon Ratchasima, Buri Ram, Chaiyaphum in the Northeast; and Nakhon Sawan, Uthai Thani, Chai Nat, Kanchanaburi, Suphan Buri and Chachoengsao in the central region. A total of 5,809 villages were affected in 674 subdistricts of 127 districts. ([Bangkok Post, 11 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3518389/))

The Eastern Royal Rainmaking Operations Center stepped up operations to offset drought and replenish reservoirs in aid of fruit growers in severely affected provinces of Chanthaburi, Chonburi, and Rayong. The center was established at U-Tapao Airport to cope with a prevailing drought affecting the Eastern region. The center began work in February 2020. So far, six missions totaling seven flights have resulted in moderate showers. ([Govt. of Thailand, 11 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3600799/))

**Vietnam**

The Department of Water Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, announced that drought condition in the north central region will continue until early August. Nearly 14,900 ha of crops are affected, accounting for nearly 3.2 percent of the total. In the south central region, about 54,400 ha will be impacted, making up 15 percent of the total. Nearly 138,800 regional households will lack water for daily use. ([ECHO, 23 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3226913))

A drought affecting the Mekong Region may have a serious impact on crop production and food security in Viet Nam. According to the Viet Nam Disaster Management Authority, the Mekong Delta and Central Highlands regions have been facing abnormal weather that could be attributed to climate change. Retention of water by dams in upstream areas is also seen as contributing to record-low water levels. The Mekong River levels in June and July 2019 significantly fell compared to previous years, raising concern of exacerbated drought and saline intrusion for the entire Mekong Delta in the 2019-20 dry season. Concerns on the impact this may have on rice crop production have already led to a rise in regional rice export prices. ([OCHA, 30 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3459948))

The ongoing drought, water shortage and saltwater intrusion have so far affected 82,000 households and are exposing a higher number of vulnerable people in the Mekong Delta region to significant water shortage risks. A total of 13 out of the 63 provinces of Viet Nam have been affected and 3 provinces (Kien Giang, Ben Tre and Tien Giang) have declared a state of emergency. ([UNCT Viet Nam, 27 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3542258))

The level of snow throughout the country reached 30 – 190 mm, which is extreme, with most of snow falling in the central and northern part of the Republic. The Government announced code of danger “yellow” in the country. On 11-12 January the roads were closed for any movement, but after 24 hours cleaned
and opened again. 14 communities in 5 districts were left without electricity for one day. Low temperatures were registered (-5 to -11 Co). Low temperatures in Moldova have been registered until the end of January. On the 20th of January several regions of the country were affected by the icy rain, which covered all the roads in snow. It is reported that in total 5,460 people
were affected by the disaster. Many people with limited physical mobility and living alone were blocked in their houses limiting their ability to purchase required items, including food. Due to the lower than normal temperatures the housing condition proved to not be adequate to keep households warm. The most vulnerable are unable to afford the costs of heating and are concerned that additional costs associated with heating will indebt them further. Out of 5,460 affected people, 2,912 need Red Cross assistance. These are mainly older people, people with disabilities or people with very low income in their families. Because of their poverty, they can’t afford to heat the houses as the heating costs are very high. With the limited income, people prefer to spend money on food or for medicines rather than on heating or electricity put them at risk of developing illnesses and further exacerbating their difficult situation.

Tropical Depression Amang - Jan 2019,"Heavy rainfall (greater than 7.5 mm per hour) is currently expected over Caraga Region (Region XIII), Davao Region (Region XI) and Eastern Visayas (VIII). The weather disturbance is expected to make landfall over the southern part of Davao region and traverse north through Caraga, Eastern Visayas up to Bicol region. 

Caraga is particularly vulnerable as these are mountainous areas with river valleys and are susceptible to floods and landslides. The current landfall is forecasted for Caraga Region, Surigao del Sur Province located along the northeastern coast of Mindanao. Situated west is the Diwata Mountain Range, isolating the province from the rest of Mindanao.

With height of 30-90 cm, the event has produced 168 fatalities, 745 injured, 30 missing, 558 houses damaged, 9 hotel units damaged, 60 damaged food stalls, 350 boats damaged. ([IFRC, 23 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2928694))

As of 24 December 2018, at 07:00 local time, the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) has confirmed that 281 people have been killed, 1,016 people are injured, and 57 people remain missing. An estimated 11,700 people are reportedly displaced. The tsunami has also damaged 611 houses, 69 hotel and villas, 60 shops, and 420 vessels. These figures are expected to increase as the government’s assessment continues. BNPB, together with the military, police, the National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS), local government, Ministry of Social Affairs Volunteers (TAGANA), Indonesian Red Cross (PMI), volunteers and the community are providing immediate assistance to those affected.  The Government of Indonesia has not requested international assistance in responding to the situation. ([OCHA 24 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2929269/))

According to the latest report from BNPB, 430 people have died, 148 people remain missing and a further 1,485 people have sustained injuries, while more than 16,000 people have still been displaced. The BNPB, Indonesian Army, various local government bodies and the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) are leading the response operations. Evacuation, search and rescue of victims continue. Joint forces with volunteers and the community began to clean the environment from the tsunami debris. The volcanic activity is still ongoing, namely in the form of Strombolian eruptions accompanied by throws of incandescent lava and hot clouds. For this reason the authorities have upgraded the volcano status to Alert level (Level 3, second highest level), with the danger zone extended to 5 km. Dominant winds lead to the south-west so that volcanic ash spreads south-west to the sea. Heavy rain made search and rescue operations more difficult. More than 1,650 people of Banten province, who had been hit by the tsunami, have been affected by the floods caused by Cikalumpang River overflowing its banks on 26 December.

Southern Africa: Drought - 2018-2022,"The number of severely food insecure people in Southern Africa rose to an estimated 9.6 million at the start of the lean season (October 2018 to April 2019), due to an increase of 1.1 million people in Malawi. Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique.  ([OCHA, 26 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2889353))

Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid‑December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. ([GIEWS, 22 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2960209))

Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns.

FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time.

Between December 2021 and March 2022, around 336,000 people (29% of the population in **Eswatini**) are estimated to be facing high acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 Crisis or above) and require urgent humanitarian assistance. Of this population, 286,000 people are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 50,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). An additional 376,000 are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) and require livelihood support. Compared to the October 2021 - March 2022 projection period from the August 2021 analysis, this update shows a slight deterioration, with a slight increase in the food insecure population in IPC Phase 3 or above in all livelihood zones except for Highveld Cattle and Maize, Timber Highlands and Moist Middleveld, with the latter two having 47% of their households having food stocks lasting more than six months. This update has seen the population projected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above increase by 19,000 people. ([IPC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811185))

**Tanzania**: For the current period of analysis (November 2021 - April 2022), about 437,000 people, representing 13% of an analysed population of 3.4 million, are estimated to be experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Overall, an estimated 22,000 people (1% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and around 415,000 people (12% of the population analysed) in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Around 785,000 people (23% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Amongst the 14 councils of Tanzania analysed (12 district councils [DCs] and the rural parts of two town councils [TCs]), four councils (Handeni DC, Longido, Mkinga, and Monduli) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), with 20% to 30% of their population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (Phase 3 or above). The rest of the councils are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). [(IPC, 1 Mar 2022)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822422/))

Approximately 5.4 million people in Malawi living in rural and secondary urban centres are facing Moderate or Severe chronic food insecurity (IPC CFI Levels 3 and 4) due to abject poverty and recurrent shocks, among other drivers. The February Malawi IPC Chronic Food Insecurity (CFI) analysis found that an additional estimated 4.4 million people face Mild food insecurity, whilst approximately 6.9 million people face No/Minimal chronic food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity in Malawi, where over 70% of the population of about 19.1 million people is living below the international poverty line of $1.90/day, is driven by abject poverty, recurrent shocks, poor policies and implementation as well as reliance on weak livelihood strategies.

Iraq: Floods - Nov 2018,"Torrential rainfall on 22-23 November caused severe flooding across Iraq, leading to the displacement of thousands of people and multiple deaths and injuries. Ninewa and Salah al-Din are the most heavily affected governorates, with bridges, roads and villages being inundated; damage was also recorded in the southern part of the country. An estimated 10,000 people in Salah al-Din and 15,000 people in Ninewa need assistance, including thousands of families living in IDP camps. ([OCHA, 25 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2888688))

Central and northwestern Iraq has experienced several episodes of torrential rainfall and severe flooding over a three-week period, most notably on 22/23 November, 30-November/1-December, and 6/7 December. These episodes were interspersed by rainy periods of lesser intensity, which nonetheless adversely affected clean-up efforts. Iraq often experiences heavy rains during winter, but storms this year have been more acute than usual. Ninewa bore the brunt of the severe weather, although other governorates were also affected.
The storms washed away buildings, roads, and bridges, and flooded IDP camps and urban areas. A temporary state of emergency was declared in Mosul on 2-December after several neighborhoods were inundated and multiple buildings collapsed. Debris clearance and rehabilitation efforts are underway, but concerns about unexploded ordinance (UXO) must be factored into response efforts.
After the initial floods on 22/23 November, camp management in several IDP camps in Ninewa instituted contingency planning which diminished the impact of subsequent storms; however, it is imperative to ensure that all 125 of Iraq’s IDP camps are restored to minimally acceptable standards, including improved flood mitigation measures.

Madagascar: Measles Outbreak - Oct 2018,"Madagascar has been experiencing a measles outbreak since early October 2018. The outbreak started in the urban health district of Antananarivo Renivohitra (in the heart of the capital city, Antanarivo) on 4 October 2018 when three measles cases were confirmed at the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM) by serology. The disease then spread to other health districts (Tanà South, Tanà North and Ambohidratrimo) in Analamanga Region (where the capital city is located) and subsequently to other parts of the country. The Ministry of Public Health formally declared the measles outbreak on 26 October 2018.

As of 18 November 2018, a total of 3 239 measles cases have been reported, of which 182 were confirmed immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive and 3 057 were epidemiologically linked. No deaths have been reported to date. A total of 23 districts (out of 114) in 12 regions (out of 22) are currently in epidemic phase. The urban health district of Antananarivo-Renivohitra is the most affected, accounting for 84% (2 730) of all reported cases. The other health districts with high numbers of cases are Ambatondratrimo (6%, 200), Antananarivo-Atsimondrano (3%, 91). The remaining health districts have fewer cases..The current measles outbreak has occurred at a time when there is some resurgence of plague in the country, straining the public health response system. The ongoing political election, with the risks of social tensions and conflict, has also downgraded the response to these public health events. ([WHO, 23 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2890193/))    

The measles outbreak in Madagascar has seen a dramatic increase in incidence cases in the last three weeks. Since our last report on 23 November 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 47), 6 125 additional cases have been reported, of which 89 were laboratory-confirmed (immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive) and 6 036 were epidemiologically linked. Eleven new districts have been affected during the past three weeks...The continuous propagation and the rapid increase in the number of measles cases in Madagascar is concerning. The outbreak is already in highly populated areas, and in a largely non-immune population as indicated by the wide range of the age groups affected. Given the high transmissibility of measles, it can be expected that this outbreak may evolve exponentially. ([WHO, 14 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2920023/))

The measles outbreak in Madagascar continues to improve, with the trend showing a marked decline. Since our last report on 28 December 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 52), there have been 2 317 additional measles cases reported, of which 231 were confirmed (immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive) and 87 epidemiologically linked...While the situation is improving, the risk of the outbreak spreading to the few remaining unaffected regions of the country remains. Although the first phase of the reactive vaccination campaign progressed well, there is still a shortage of vaccines and funds for response in those districts at risk, and funding gaps need to be filled for phases two and three of the campaign, planned for February through April 2019.

Despite stabilizing in some areas, the above-mentioned spikes show that the epidemic is progressing, and the epidemic is now posing significant risk to remote and hard to reach communities as seen in below table, which summarizes the rate at which the disease has been spreading with 7,288 new cases in March 2019 (weeks 9 to 12).

Madagascar: Plague Outbreak - Sep 2018,"On 19 August 2018, one suspected case of bubonic plague was reported in Ankazobe, Analamanga region. Subsequently, suspected pneumonic and bubonic cases have been reported in endemic and non-endemic areas of Madagascar.

([WHO, 21 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2800374))    

Early action is urgently required to avert a greater loss of life due to the plague outbreak ahead of an expected seasonal peak between November 2018 to March 2019. The timing also coincides with a Presidential elections period of October-December which will significantly increases the risk of transmission due to daily meetings of large crowds in all major cities in the country. A number of pneumonic cases have already been recorded in several districts close to the Capital and Pneumonic plague is highly transmissible (person-to-person) and can quickly cause death in the absence of treatment. Since 19 August the cumulative number of confirmed and suspected cases in the country is higher than the average and the maximum of 2012-2016. From August to 05 November 2018, a total of 106 cases of plague have been reported, in 23 out of 114 districts in the country; out of which, 36 are confirmed in 12 districts and 8 regions. To date, 9 deaths (case fatality rate 9.4%) have been registered, among which 6 cases were pneumonic and 4 of bubonic form. It is important to note that all of these deaths occurred in the community, highlighting weaknesses in the early warning system and low community awareness, both of which increase the risk of the outbreak spreading.. ([OCHA, 13 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2881958))

Due to the need to continue post-epidemic and prevention activities, the IFRC response operation has been extended the first time over 15 months until 31 December 2018 and will be extended over 19 months to cover all period of plague season until the end of April 2019 considered as the end of the plague season. From 19 august to 26 November, 124 cases of plague have been recorded with 91 bubonic form (73.4 %), 31 pulmonary form (25%), 1 septicaemia case and one unspecified. A quarter of the cases a pulmonary originated from the plague form which can be transmitted from human to human and causes an outbreak as it happens last year.

As reported, a total of 469,230 people was displaced to 3,678 evacuation centers and 628,006 people displaced to other locations. Those figures have dropped significantly to 897 people still in evacuation centers in Region III, CALABARZON and CAR; while 13,924 people are still displaced in the same regions while staying with host families ([IFRC, 24 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2845573)).

Just a month after Typhoon Mangkhut, Typhoon Yutu (locally known as Rosita) made landfall as a Category-1 storm on 30 October in Dinapigue, Isabela and traversed northern Luzon in a similar path to Typhoon Mankghut. Affected communities starting to recover from Typhoon Mangkhut were again evacuated and disrupted. Local communities of Abra, Cagayan, Ifugao, Isabela and Mountain Province were affected by the repeated displacement. ([OCHA, 9 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2867743/)).

Residents in northern and central Luzon are beginning to recover three months after typhoon Mangkhut (locally named Ompong) and six weeks following Typhoon Yutu (locally named Rosita) devastated the regions. According to the last report of Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on 6 November, over 13,400 people in Region III (Central Luzon) are still staying in evacuation centres or with relatives. Meanwhile, in its 18 November report on Typhoon Yutu, DSWD noted about 1,400 people remained displaced in the Cordilleras Administrative Region, including 315 people staying in evacuation centres in Itogon and Tuba, Benguet province. To support the national and local response and early recovery efforts, the Philippines Humanitarian Country Team updated and expanded its humanitarian response and resources overview document in November to address the early recovery needs of 165,000 people through March 2019, for which it seeks US$31 million. ([OCHA, 21 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2926494/)).

The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) is set to grant agricultural and livelihood assistance to 493 families affected by Typhoon Mangkhut in the municipality of Baggao in Cagayan Province. The recovery program targets farmers, as well as farm laborers and households who belong under the social vulnerability criteria. Cagayan Province is the worst hit by the typhoon with over 15,000 individuals displaced. The province also suffered at least P4.4 billion in agricultural damages.

Zimbabwe: Cholera Outbreak - Sep 2018,"On 6 September 2018, a cholera outbreak was declared in Harare by the Ministry of Health...after confirmation of 11 cases for cholera on rapid diagnostic test kits and the clinical presentation. ([WHO, 7 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2780094))

Authorities report that the outbreak began on 1 September in Harare and as of that date to 11 September, the Ministry of Health and Child Care reports that there have been nearly 2000 suspected cholera cases, including 58 confirmed cases and 24 deaths.

Glenview, a high density suburb of Harare with an active trading area and a highly mobile population, is at the epicentre of the outbreak. The area is vulnerable to cholera because of inadequate supplies of safe piped water, which has led people to use alternative unsafe supplies such as wells and boreholes. Cases that are linked to the epicenter in Harare have been confirmed in 5 additional provinces.

The Government of Zimbabwe has declared a state of emergency and is working with international partners to rapidly expand recommended cholera response actions, including increasing access to clean and safe water in the most affected communities and decommissioning contaminated water supplies. Authorities and partners are also intensifying health education to ensure that suspect cases seek care immediately and establishing cholera treatment centres closer to affected communities. ([WHO, 13 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2785114))

An outbreak of cholera declared on 6 September has killed at least 30 people and infected at least 5,460. The most severely affected areas are the two epicentres of the outbreaks in the suburbs of Glenview and Budiriro in western Harare. The outbreak has spread from Harare to Chitungwiza, and west to Gokwe and Bulawayo. Cholera is reportedly spreading to different areas of the country. Poor WASH and health infrastructure are facilitating the rapid spread of the disease. High WASH needs, including clean drinking water, hygiene promotion and temporary sanitation facilities, have been reported. ([ACAPS, 18 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2791419))

As of 19 October 2018, a cumulative total of 9 404 cases with 54 deaths (case fatality ratio 0.57%) have been reported from nine provinces across the country. Of the reported cases, 231 are confirmed by culture. Harare (9 096 cases) and Chitungwiza (110 cases) cities in Harare Province have reported the majority of the cases (suspected and confirmed) accounting for 98% of the cumulative cases reported across the country. The most affected areas in Harare City are the densely populated urban suburbs of Glen View (4 154 cases), Budiriro (2 691 cases), Mbare (373 cases) and Glen Nora (297 cases). Other provinces reporting cases include Manicaland Province (100), Bulawayo (38), Mashonaland East province (35), Mashonaland Central province (11), Midlands Province (10), Masvingo (2), atabeleland South (1), and Mashonaland West (1).

The cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has markedly improved, following strong interventions by the national authorities and partners. However, sporadic cases continue to occur in Harare city, while a new and fast-evolving foci has emerged in Mount Darwin District, which requires urgent attention. The occurrence of  poradic cholera cases in Harare city has been dragging on for several weeks and could serve as a potential source of infection to other places, such as the ongoing flare-up in Mount Darwin District. ([WHO, 30 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2900093))

Chiredzi district in Masvingo Province is the latest area to report an outbreak of cholera with three suspected cases, of which one has been confirmed by culture. Across the country, 15 new cases were reported on 12 December 2018, with nine from Harare City and six from Mount Darwin District in Mashonaland Central Province. The outbreak is largely under control in Harare City, but there has been a recent spike of cases in Mount Darwin and Chiredzi districts. ([WHO, 14 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2920023/))

The cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has continued to improve since its onset in week 36 (week ending 9 September 2018). The declining trend observed
since the peak of the outbreak in week 38 continues to be maintained despite an upsurge in week 48 caused by the emergence of new cases in
Mount Darwin District in Mashonaland Central province where the outbreak is ongoing. Harare city has not reported new cases since 11 December
2018. Since our last report on 30 November 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 48), there have been 161 new cases of cholera with four deaths reported nationally. ([WHO, 21 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2929874))

Thirty-one cases were identified retrospectively and added to the cumulative number of cases. Majority of these retrospective cases were reported from Harare with onset between 12 and 25 December 2018. There has been a dramatic decline in the number of new cases with only two cases reported across the country in the week leading to 5 January 2019.

The drought situation in Sindh and Balochistan is rapidly developing into one of the worst disasters in Pakistan. Upland Balochistan and Sindh in the south are the most heavily affected by severe drought. These affected areas of Balochistan and Sindh have been prone to water shortages, rainfall measured over the last few years has reached a record low, with minimal or sometimes no rainfall. PMD said in its alert that “severe to extreme drought-like conditions” have emerged over most of the southern parts of Pakistan due to lack of summer rain. The abrupt decline in rainfall in most of the upland areas of the province has caused a complete drying up of the surface drinking water resources and has decreased water output from springs and tube wells...On 7 February 2019, NDMA organized a Strategic Coordination Forum / Steering Committee Meeting, supported by UNOCHA with the agenda in discussing the drought response plan 2019, and the Chairman of NDMA officially requested international stakeholders to support the serious issue and drought victims, including Red Cross Red Crescent Movement.

Pakistan has experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of drought due a rise in temperatures, adverse effects of El Nino and a decrease in rainfall during the monsoon season. As per the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), severe drought-like conditions have emerged over much of southern Pakistan, with an expectation for further deterioration over the next 4 years. In 2018 Pakistan received reduced rainfall during the monsoon season (May to August), with Sindh 69.5 per cent below average, and Balochistan 45 per cent below.  This has resulted in acute shortages of water, food and
fodder. The Government of Pakistan estimates some 5 million people are affected by the drought in 26 districts in Sindh and Balochistan.([Gov/UNCT, 20 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3265683))

Ghana: Floods - Aug 2018,"Since early August 2018, communities in Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana have been affected by heavy and continuous seasonal rainfalls, which was later exacerbated by the annual opening of the Bagre dam gates. Indeed, the Bagre Dam, located in Burkina Faso, caused unprecedented flooding in many local communities, destroying lives and properties. The Bagre Dam spilled on the 31st of August 2018, when the dam reached its maximum spillage level at 235m on that day. However, by the 10th of September, the dam was still spilling, and water level remained at the maximum level of 235m.

The continued rise in water levels resulted in flooding which has affected farmlands, posing threat to lives and properties as the spilled water found its way into the Black and White Volta Rivers, which overflowed into the three regions of the north and the Eastern Region. According to an assessment report by the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO), about 11,959.6 Hectares of farmland have been affected by the flooding, posing a food insecurity risk to the affected communities.

The country continues to receive more rains, which contributes to worsening the situation. Several families living close to the banks of the Black and White Volta Rivers, have relocated to other communities for shelter and safety. An initial assessment report produced by NADMO highlights the devastating impact of the floods. Some 23 communities in 2 districts (13 communities in Bakwu West District and 11 communities in Talensi Districts) with a total of 3,556 households (21,336) people have been affected in the Upper East region, whilst in the Northern region 202 communities in 9 districts thus 10,567 people have been affected, leading to a total of 31,903 people (5,317 households) affected in both regions.

Madagascar: Drought - 2018-2024,"Severe drought conditions during southern Madagascar’s rainy season from November 2017 to April 2018 have led to nearly dry dams in many parts of the south. This dryness has affected livestock’s access to water and pastureland, which has led to poor livestock body conditions as many are subsisting on burnt cactus leaves in the absence of viable pastureland. This has similarly affected crop development, with many areas experiencing failed or near failed harvests. Only Ambovombe commune received favorably heavy rains in July that allowed some farmers to plant new maize and potato crops...Poor and very poor households in MG23 (the Mahafaly plains) in the southwest of Madagascar are experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity because of poor or failed agricultural production and the resulting early dependence on markets for food. In Androy Semi-Arid Cassava, Maize and Livestock (MG 24), food security is deteriorating following the harvest period as stocks deplete and poor and very poor households are currently in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Ambovombe where the situation is better.

Out of 1.3 million people who are classified in IPC crisis (3) and emergency (4) phases, WFP aims to provide food assistance and nutritional support to 849,000 people using a combination of food and cash-based modalities. It is expected that other  actors in the food security sector (government and NGOs) will provide assistance to 35% of the population in IPC 3 and 4 phases. A second response phase to support drought-affected communities through early recovery interventions is planned for the January-March 2019 period. During both response phases, WFP will work closely with FAO and other food security and livelihoods cluster members to ensure that the assistance provided is complementary.

([FEWS NET, 03 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3546453))


By the end of July 2020, corresponding to the harvest period, the number of people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in the nine districts analysed will likely reach approximately 527 000 (23% of the population analysed, an increase of almost 10% compared to the estimate made in October 2019). As for the number of people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), it is estimated at 27,400, or 1% of the population analysed. Despite the humanitarian aid provided since January 2020 and planned until July 2020, eight districts will likely remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Tulear 2 in Stress (IPC Phase 2). Almost all the districts of the Great South were affected by the drought that occurred between January and March 2020. Ampanihy and Tsihombe Districts are the most affected, with 25% of households expected to be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 5% in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  ([IPC, 29 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3625504))

During the period from February to April 2020, six districts were classified in the Serious Phase (IPC Phase 3): Tulear 2, Ampanihy in the region of Atsimo-Andrefana, then Beloha and Ambovombe in the region of Androy. The districts of Betioky in the AtsimoAndrefana region and Tolagnaro in the Anosy region were classified in the Alert phase (IPC Phase 2). However, there were no districts classified as Critical (IPC Phase 4) or Extremely Critical (IPC Phase 5). A slight improvement in the nutritional situation is expected in all districts following the post-harvest period, which would be negatively impacted by an increase in diseases and the negative impacts of COVID-19 on food systems and access to health services between May and August 2020. Furthermore, the nutritional situation is expected to deteriorate in all the six districts beyond August due to the agricultural lean season and the persistence of the effects of COVID-19, which will push Betioky district into IPC Phase 3 (Serious) and Ambovombe district into the Critical phase (IPC Phase 4), requiring special attention and an urgent and targeted response.

Southern Madagascar is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe, with 1.5 million people—half the region’s population—needing immediate emergency food assistance, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned today. Three straight years of drought have wiped out harvests and hampered people's access to food and COVID-19 is compounding their suffering. Those experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” hunger conditions—three times the number forecast mid-year—are mostly children and women. Of the ten hardest-hit southern districts, Amboasary is the epicenter; families barely scrape together enough food with raw mangoes and tamarind often their only food source. Mothers can no longer breastfeed and are forced to give their infants water which is in scarce supply. A WFP assessment in Amboasary last month found three out of four children had quit school - mostly to help their parents forage for food. ([WFP, 30 Nov 2020](https://reliwefweb.int/node/3692636))

 According to a review conducted by WFP, this year's drought is the most severe in the past 10 years. This includes more than 1.1 million people—more than 1 in every 3 people in the region—who are projected to face severe food insecurity during the 2021 lean season (January to April), according to the latest IPC analysis. During this period, two districts will be in Emergency phase (IPC Phase 4)—Amboasary and Bekily—and six districts will be in Crisis phase (IPC Phase 3). ([OCHA, 18 Jan 2021](https://reliwefweb.int/node/3705243))

Over the past six years (2015/16-2020/21) southern Madagascar has experienced five below-average rainy seasons. The past two consecutive below-average seasons have led to a severe reduction in staple food production and declined livestock herd size and body condition. Poor households’ 2019/20 food stocks ran out in September, two months earlier than usual, and crops from the 2020/21 season will not be available until May and will likely be below average. Available information suggests poor households are selling more livestock and other productive assets for income to purchase food, and food aid through January helped mitigate consumption deficits for some households. Overall low income coupled with high staple food prices will continue to drive Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in much of southern Madagascar even during the 2021 harvest. ([FEWS NET, 15 Mar 2021](https://reliwefweb.int/node/3718648))

A sustained deterioration in food insecurity is expected in Madagascar’s Grand South regions from April to December 2021. Over 1.1 million people are highly food insecure in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse due to insufficient rainfall, rising food prices, and sandstorms. The lean season is expected to begin earlier than usual for the current consumption year, as households will deplete their low food stocks due to minimal production. During the current analysis period (April to September 2021), which begins with a harvest period, 1.14 million people need urgent action (IPC Phase 3 or worse). ([IPC, 9 Jul 2021](https://reliwefweb.int/node/3754964))

A significant scale-up of sustained assistance across southern Madagascar is required to prevent high levels of acute malnutrition and hunger-related mortality, particularly in Ambovombe and Ampanihy districts, where Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are expected during the 2021/22 lean season, with some populations expected to be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) in Ambovombe. Leading up to the 2021/22 lean season, area-level Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in these districts with households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Other areas in southern Madagascar will likely face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes throughout the outlook period, with a significant number of poor households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). ([FEWS NET, 17 Jul 2021](https://reliwefweb.int/node/3757223))


Ongoing and planned humanitarian food assistance is anticipated to improve food security outcomes between September and October across much of southern Madagascar. Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in most areas during this time. While humanitarian food assistance is helping to improve outcomes across southern Madagascar, any pipeline breaks in December and January may result in outcomes further deteriorating to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes in Ambovombe, Ampanihy, and Tsihombe districts, due to the poor cassava harvest, above-average food prices, and significantly limited labor opportunities.

A DG ECHO and EU Delegation Joint visit to the Grand Sud in Madagascar took place from 15 to 25 November 2021. The mission visited three districts in the two most affected regions by the drought related to climate change and lack of investments in the Grand Sud. The scarce or delayed rains are insufficient for minimum local crop production and keep the rivers dry. The drought continues and the communities are now entering the lean season. The prevalence of moderate and severe acute malnutrition observed are already above emergency thresholds in some communities, when the peak of the crisis is expected only in March/April 2022. Between October - December 2021, around 1.31 million people are in IPC3 and higher, over 480,000 in IPC4 and nearly 28,000 in IPC5. ([ECHO, 29 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3795810))

Despite ongoing interventions, food insecurity in Madagascar’s Grand South and Grand South-East remains high, with 1.64 million people classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4), corresponding to 37% of the population analyzed. The persisting food and nutrition crisis is exacerbated by prolonged drought, insecurity and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most-affected districts, classified in Emergency, include Amboasary Atsimo, Ambovombe Androy, Ampanihy and Tsihombe, hosting nearly 300,000 people among the 400,000 people in these conditions. Humanitarian food assistance has provided broad coverage in terms of the number of beneficiaries over the past few months, thus averting a catastrophic situation. Nevertheless, this assistance remains insufficient to meet all kilocaloric needs and to sustainably address household consumption deficits, leaving people in continuous need of urgent action. During the lean season (January to April 2022), due to the expected increase in rations provided by humanitarian food assistance, especially in the Grand South, a slight decrease in the number of people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) is expected, while that in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) will likely remain similar. Thus, around 334,000 people (8% of the population analysed) are estimated to remain in IPC Phase 4 and around 1.3 million people (30% of the population analyzed) in IPC Phase 3, adding up to around 1.64 million people in IPC Phases 3 or 4. However, the districts of Amboasary Atsimo, Ambovombe Androy and Ampanihy West will likely remain classified in IPC Phase 4. ([IPC, 03 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3805270))


After being hit by the storm systems of Ana, Batsirai and Dumaki, Emnati is now the fourth storm system to have affected Madagascar in the space of 40 days between late January and early March. In addition, the three regions of the Grand Sud-Est were affected by the cyclones and tropical storms Vatovavy, Fitovinany and Atsimo Atsinanana. For the first time, the districts of the **Grand Sud-Est**, with the exception of Vangaindrano, are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) even in the middle of the harvest period. The number of people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) is approximately 67,000 (including 15% of the population of Mananjary and 5% of the population of Manakara). Nearly 638,000 people are classified as IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above and require urgent action, representing 31% of the populations of the districts analyzed. In the **Grand Sud**, although the situation remains fragile, it has improved significantly compared to April 2021, with a decrease in the number of people classified as IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Despite humanitarian aid that is the mainstay of the household economy, from April to August 2022, 33% of the population in the Grand Sud is still highly food insecure (IPC Phase 3 or above), including 122,000 people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and 925,000 in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Although rainfall has been good, production remains low, despite a significant increase (greater than the previous two seasons) that has been observed or is expected in some districts. Bekily District is an exception to this trend, with 55% of its population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse due to drought. Ambovombe is also an exception, with 45% of its population in IPC Phase 3 or worse.  ([IPC, 30 May 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3851605))

Humanitarian actors are currently delivering assistance to approximately 415,463 beneficiaries across the Grand South, with the highest levels of assistance in Ampanihy and Betoiky. 154,078 beneficiaries are receiving 100,000 MGA per month in cash transfers, and 261,385 beneficiaries are receiving 30 kg of rice, 5 kg of legumes, and 3 kg of cooking oil per month. Both types of assistance represent 50 percent of kilocalorie needs, and are covering at least a portion of household’s food gaps, thus preventing worse outcomes in areas where assistance is highest. However, as funding past January 2023 has not yet been secured, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes remain likely in worst-affected areas of southwestern Madagascar. Should funding be secured, it remains highly likely that there will be a gap in its delivery during February, resulting in a deterioration of food security outcomes until humanitarian assistance delivery can be re-established. ([FEWS NET, 28 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3920122))

In the current period from October 2023 – January 2024, 1.31 million people face high levels of acute food insecurity - IPC Phase 3 or above Crisis level - on the Acute Food Insecurity (AFI) classification, with 43,000 people in IPC Phase 4, Emergency level in the Grand Sud and the Grand Sud-Est, and nearly 459,000 children under 5 facing/expected to face elevated levels of acute malnutrition. For the first projected period from February - April 2024, a rapid deterioration is expected due to the seasonal lean season. Overall, 1.71 million people , 22% of the population are expected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above on the AFI classification, with 119,000 in Phase 4. During this lean season period, the most isolated districts, Nosy Varika and Ikongo, are projected to move to Phase 4 Critical level on the IPC Acute Malnutrition (AMN) classification. Three determining factors have been highlighted in the analysis: the continued inflation and structural inaccessibility; a rise in the prevalence of water-related diseases and El Niño and its induced effects that could jeopardize the agricultural season.

In Haiti between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 36 of 2018, 3,111 suspected cases were reported (Figure 1), including 37 deaths. The incidence rate for 2018 (until EW 36) is 25.5 cases per 100,000 population, which is the lowest recorded incidence since the beginning of the outbreak. Following the increase in cases that were reported in EW 19, a decrease has been observed, with a weekly average of 35 suspected cases reported over the last 8 weeks (EW 29 to EW 36). The cumulative case-fatality rate (CFR) has remained around 1% since 2011.

In the Dominican Republic, between EW 1 and EW 38 of 2018, 113 suspected cases of cholera were reported, representing an incidence rate of 1.52 cases per 100,000 population; this incidence rate is greater than the incidence rate reported for the same period in 2017 (1.43 cases per 100,000 population). Of the cases reported this year, 77% (n= 87) correspond to an outbreak that affected the province of Independencia between July and August 2018.

The agencies also warned that the possible arrival of an El Niño before the end of 2018 could exacerbate the precarious food and nutrition security of vulnerable rural communities. The months of June and July registered lower-than-average rainfall and drier-than-average conditions, which affected the first and principal crop cycle in Central America, known as the “primera”. Total or partial loss of crops means that subsistence farmers and their families will not have enough food to eat or sell in coming months.

Sudan: Floods - Jul 2018,"Flooding has affected over 45,000 people, led to 23 human deaths and 61 injuries. In addition, more than 8,900 families have been rendered homeless and are currently putting up in temporary sites in their neighbours and relative’s houses. 

These rains have caused significant damage to key infrastructure such as bridges and roads as well as amenities like schools, latrines and local dispensaries. In addition, livelihoods have been significantly affected as farms were submerged in water and livestock washed away. Power outages occur severally due to collapsing of power lines.  

The Sudanese Meteorological Authority and the Ministry of Water Resources and Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC)’s early warming bulletin indicate that heavy rainfall is forecasted to continue over the eastern parts of the country as well as over Butana plains, including River Nile, the Red Sea state as well as Central and Western Darfur states. Additionally, the Blue Nile river and River Nile are expected to rise due to increased precipitation and this may cause river flooding and subsequently displacements and other needs amongst populations living along the riverine ([IFRC, 13 Aug 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2740704))

At least 6,000 homes in West Kordofan and Kassala states have been affected by recent heavy rains and floods, said the government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC).  In anticipation of above average rains this year in most parts of Sudan, a monthly Flood Task Force (FTF) composed of humanitarian partners—under the auspices of HAC---was reactivated in late June to put in place a four-month flood contingency plan for the country. The first meeting of the FTF focused on early warning and information management, Sector preparedness, response and coordination ([OCHA, 15 Jul 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2726684))

Flooding induced by torrential rain across Sudan has displaced more than 50,000 people since mid-July. Reports indicate at least 23 fatalities with many more injuries. Damage to crops and livestock deaths from flooding occurred in localized areas of West Kordofan, Kassala, and Darfur States. In areas with reported crop damage, households are replanting fields as seasonal rains continue. Areas with no flooding continue to have above-average rainfall with favorable crop development and pasture generation ([FEWSNET, 31 Aug 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2768219))

Heavy rains and consequent flash floods have so far affected more than 142,000 people, damaging households and livelihoods in 14 out of Sudan’s 18 states, West Kordofan, Kassala and Gedaref being the hardest hit. ([OCHA, 19 Aug 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2795019))

Widespread flooding is expected to have lingering livelihood impacts and likely lead to some slight crop production shortfalls, especially in the worst flood-affected regions in the eastern, northern, and western regions of the country. Field reports indicate that poor households in some of these flood-affected areas have replanted fast-maturing sorghum varieties, and their overall performance will rely heavily on the continued moisture in coming months. ([FEWSNET, 5 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2820784))

Over 200,000 people in 15 of Sudan’s 18 states have been affected by heavy rains and flash floods between June and early November, according to the Government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). This is almost double the 122,500 people affected by floods the same time last year. The worst affected states are Kassala (47,500 people), Sennar (33,800 people) and West Kordofan (33,200 people).

Lao PDR/Cambodia: Floods - Jul 2018,"Heavy rainfall over a period of several days in Attapeu Province resulted in dangerously high river and dam levels. An incident at the Xepien-Xenamnoy Hydropower dam construction in Attapeu province resulted in flash flooding, with eight villages affected: Ban Mai; Ban HinLath; Ban ThaSengchan; Ban Thahintai; Ban Sanong; Ban Thae; Ban Phonsa-ath; and Ban Nongkhae. ([UNCT Laos/OCHA, 24 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2712609/))

The collapse of the dam affected nearly 7,000 people and displacing more than 1,000 people. More than 100 houses were damaged, forcing people to seek shelter in local government buildings and schools. Red Cross teams in the Attepeu branch have distributed clothing, food and drinking water to households in the affected area. ([IFRC/Lao Red Cross, 25 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2712694))

On 26 July, The IFRC released an [appeal](https://reliefweb.int/node/2716249) seeking a total of some 2.9 million Swiss francs, on a preliminary basis, to enable the [IFRC] to support the Lao Red Cross (LRC) to deliver assistance and support 7,500 people for 18 months. ([IFRC, 26 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2712694))

In addition, Tropical Storm Son-Tinh affected several provinces, the most severe being Sanamxay District in the Attapeu Province. This is the largest flood the country has seen in the past 10 years.  The UN activated five clusters: WASH, Health, Food Security and Nutrition, Shelter and Logistics. ([UNCT Laos/OCHA, 29 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2720944/)) The water level is receding slowly, but road access remains difficult.

As of 28 July, 16,250 people have been affected by flooding in Attapeu Province following the impact of Tropical Storm Son Tinh that caused the Xepien-Xenamnoyu hydroelectric dam in Sanamxay District to break. 19 people are known to have died and more than 7,300 people have been displaced and are living in temporary shelters. Roads, bridges, schools and agricultural land has been damaged or destroyed, and most of the affected area remains cut off except by boat. There is an urgent need for food, sanitation and hygiene support, housing repair kits and psychosocial support.

Flood waters caused by the break of Xepien-Xenamnoyu dam in southern Lao PDR are flowing downstream, resulting in the evacuation of more than 5,600 people in Stung Treng Province, northern Cambodia. As of 31 July, no people have been reported dead or missing. The water level at Stung Treng is at 10.7m and forecast to reach flood level within five days. Local authorities are distributing relief items and NGOs have deployed staff to assist in monitoring the situation. ([OCHA, 31 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2721329/))

Tropical Storm Son-Tinh caused heavy rains in 13 provinces and unprecedented flash floods in Sanamxay District in Attapeu Province. As of 6 August, the water level is receding slowly, but access to the affected area remains challenging due to floods and mud. Some areas are accessible only by helicopter. Based on the Government’s information, 13 villages have been affected, five are considered severely affected. The Government has declared the affected area as a National Disaster Zone. Current identified needs are water, health, food, shelter and psychosocial support. ([UNCT Laos/OCHA, 6 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2731759/))

On 7 August, the Humanitarian Country Team launched a Disaster Response Plan to provide life-saving assistance to 13,100 people affected by the flash floods and re-establish their basic livelihoods. The Plan asks for US$5.6 million in humanitarian relief and recovery support across eight clusters: Education, Food Security and Nutrition, Health, Protection, including Child Protection and Gender-Based Violence, Shelter, including camp management, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, Early Recovery and Coordination.

As of 13 August, 45 districts in **Cambodia** have been affected by flooding, after flood waters flowed south from Lao PDR. Almost 70,500 families have been affected, including 7,150 families who have been evacuated from their homes. In addition, 21,400 schools and 4,100 health facilities have been impacted by the floods. Local government and NGOs are providing people with food, NFIs, health support and cash assistance. ([OCHA, 14 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2742304/))

Tropical Cyclone Bebinca led to flooding in northern Laos, with impacts also felt in the south of the country. Heavy and consistent rain since 13 August has led to rising river levels in Attapeu province, where the hydro-electric dam collapsed less than a month ago. This is causing flooding and restricting access to Sanamxay, hampering the delivery of aid to areas affected by the dam collapse. Authorities are closely monitoring the level of the Mekong River and its tributaries. ([OCHA, 20 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2750309/))

As of 6 August, the flood had affected over 13,000 people. Over 6,000 of those have been evacuated to emergency camps. UNICEF and partners, with support from USAID, are installing water points (drilling boreholes with hand motorized pump) and toilets in the camps, as well as distributing 200,000 water purification tablets.([UNICEF 12 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2788134/))

While the emergency support of the international community had originally focused on the impact of the flash floods following a dam break on 23 July in Attapeu province, given the ongoing rains, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 1 October expanded its request for assistance to the entire country.  The Humanitarian Country Team in Lao PDR have selected the six hardest-hit districts in Khammouane province, focusing on lifesaving activities, and have applied to the Central Emergency Response Fund to address the life-threating consequences of the flooding in the province.  ([OCHA, 8 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2820894/))

According to Government reports, as of 15 October, more than 2,300 villages, 126,000 families and 616,000 people were reported to be affected by the floods. A total of 16,739 people remains evacuated from their villages. 1,779 Houses were reported as destroyed and 514 as damaged. All schools in Sanamxay are now operating. However, some students irregularly attend in some primary and secondary schools, primarily due to shortages of classrooms, teachers and school meals. ([UNCT Laos/OCHA, 19 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2873548/))

With the rainy season coming to an end, the disaster damages and losses can be expected to have stabilized. The recovery phase is underway. A new six-month programme has been launched with US$ 3.5 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to provide humanitarian assistance to 110,000 households in the six most affected districts of Khammouane province.

Asia: Armyworm Infestation - Jul 2018,"Fall Armyworm is native to the Americas. However, since 2016 it has been aggressively moving ever eastwards, sweeping across Africa, and making landfall for the first time in Asia last summer. Fall Armyworm (FAW) was first detected in India in July 2018 and by January 2019, it had spread to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and China’s Yunnan Province. In the case of Sri Lanka, there were reports that up to 40,000 hectares had been infested, damaging some 20 percent of its crops. While economic losses there and in the other Asian countries have not yet been tallied, estimates of economic damage from FAW in Africa ranged from US$ 1-3 billion. In response to the sudden onset of FAW in Asia, FAO is convening a meeting of officials from the affected countries, as well as experts who’ve been tackling the fallout of FAW in Africa and Latin America – and who have been learning ways to limit the damage. ([FAO, 20 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3042928))

FAO announced the launch of a three-year Global Action for Fall Armyworm Control on 4 December in an effort to curb the growing spread of Fall Armyworm. It is seeking to mobilize $500 million between 2020 to 2022 to control the pest throughout both Africa and Asia. ([FAO, 4 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3425223))

**China**

In April, planting of 2019 maize crop was completed in the south of China with some concerns remain for the final maize output due to Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations spreading northwards from the Yunnan Province, where the pest was first detected in January 2019. As of 29 May, FAW had already spread through 15 southern provinces. ([FAO, 12 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3167484))

As of 4 July, Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations reportedly affected crops in localized areas in 19 out of the 34 provincial-level administrative divisions, mostly in southern parts of the country. Official estimates indicate that less than 1 percent of the total area planted with maize had been affected. However, this number is expected to increase if the spread is not contained. Reports from the country indicate that there is an increasing risk that FAW could spread to northern parts of the country. ([FAO, 4 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3200539))

**Indonesia**

The Fall Armyworm was first detected In Indonesia in West Sumatra in March 2019, and within 4 months the pest has moved to 12 provinces in Indonesia in Sumatra, Java and some parts of Kalimantan. The Ministry of Agriculture has been gathering information on the losses from crops infested and damaged by the pest. The local Government has been raising the awareness of farmers in the affected areas, and monitoring the fields that have been attacked. ([FAO, 17 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3219938))

**Sri Lanka**

The Fall Armyworm (FAW) or Spodoptera frugiperda has been reported in all major maize growing areas in Sri Lanka and is also affecting sugarcane cultivation. There is a growing concern that it may affect other crops, including rice. Native to the Americas, FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 and quickly spread across virtually all of Sub-Saharan Africa. In July 2018, it was confirmed in India in Karnataka state and since then it has been found in seven other States including in Tamil Nadu. ([FAO, 24 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3047413))

1,489 cholera cases (including 26 deaths) have been reported in Maradi region since 15 July. After showing signs of improvement in early August, the outbreak intensified after 10 August. More than 930 cases, including at least 19 deaths, have been reported since 11 August. The outbreak was initially contained in Madarounfa department but has now spread to the heavily populated city of Maradi, the capital of Maradi region. Heavy rainfall and floods in the area have affected more than 20,000 people and are exacerbating the risk of contamination. ([ACAPS, 24 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2757494))

The risk factors for further spread of the disease in the communities are huge. The latest WASH assessment carried out by UNICEF and WHO estimates that only 37% of the population in Maradi Region has access to basic sources of potable water, 75% of the population are said to practice open defaecation, with only 10% having access to basic sanitation. Currently, there is ongoing heavy rainfall, causing occasional floods in several places, likely to exacerbate the risk of contamination of water sources. The ongoing outbreak control measures on the ground have not been able to halt the propagation of the disease. All these factors are favourable for further escalation of the outbreak.

The cholera outbreak situation in Niger has continued to improve. Nevertheless, there is a need to continue with intense response measures, especially active surveillance, public health education/social mobilization as well as WASH interventions. The risk factors for cholera transmission are still known to be high, namely poor local hygiene and sanitation, along with major population movement and trade between the affected districts and neighbouring Nigeria, also experiencing a cholera outbreak. The upcoming vaccination campaigns may well reverse the trend still further, but while there is a poor WASH situation, the risk will remain. Cross-border activities with Nigeria need to be strengthened and national authorities need to address the underlying transmission factors in order to bring the outbreak to a complete close.

Tropical Cyclone Mekunu - May 2018,"A new tropical storm has developed in the southwest Arabian Sea where it intensified yesterday evening into Cyclone Mekunu. The cyclone is moving currently north-northwest at a speed of 11 km/h. Mekunu is expected to continue moving in this direction during the remainder of this week and make landfall near Salalah, Oman on about Saturday 26 May. A major fluctuation in tropical weather over the southern Arabian Sea known as the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is likely to cause Mekunu to strengthen further. As a result, heavy rains are forecasted for Socotra Island, followed by the southern Arabian coast from Sayhut in eastern Yemen to Salalah and Ash Shuwaymiyyah in southern Oman, which could cause local flooding and damage. ([FAO, 23 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2617934))

The impact of cyclone ‘Mekunu’ on Yemen’s eastern mainland, after it had made landfall in the Sultanate of Oman on 26 May, has been limited. Minor damage has been reported to infrastructure in the districts of Hawf and Shahan of Al Maharah Governorate. Two ships reportedly sank in Al Gaydah and the cycolone damaged agricultural equipment. Meanwhile, assessments and relief efforts continue on the island of Socotra.

Sri Lanka: Floods and Landslides - May 2018,"The southwest monsoon weather conditions have caused rainfalls since 19 May 2018 in the southwest parts of the island. By 21 May, the precipitation triggered a flood and landslide situation in the country, which has affected thousands of lives and livelihoods, as well as caused property damage. According to the situation update by the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of Sri Lanka confirmed that a total of 153,7122 people in 19 districts have been affected and 20 people have died due heavy rains, strong winds, lightning and landslides. Currently, 19,519 families have been evacuated into 339 welfare centres. Puttalam, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Colombo, Kurunegala, Kalutara and Kegalle are amongst the worst affected districts. The water levels of two main rivers, Kalu Ganga and Attanagalu-oya, are still at flood levels, but slowly receding. Some water reservoir gates are opened and release water to reduce the flood threat to other areas. Landslide warnings are still active in some districts due to the risk of landslides and power cuts and failures.

The DMC has reported the need for drinking water, wells and area cleaning, since water sources have been contaminated. The DMC is coordinating the national response efforts. The National Disaster Relief Service centre has released 44.15 million Sri Lankan rupees (approx. CHF 276,000 Swiss francs) for the response.

According to the previous experiences and scientific figures on climate condition in South Asia country including Sri Lanka, this is just the beginning of the annual monsoon season, and it is expected that the weather condition might be getting worst and extreme in the coming months.

Harvesting activities for irrigated rice, maize, millet and sorghum crops have almost finalized, while harvesting of low lying area crops will start in late January and will be completed by end-February. Due to favourable rainfall conditions and timely provision of inputs by the Government, the 2018 national cereal production is estimated at about 338 000 tonnes, about 13 percent above the previous year’s output and 5 percent above the average of the last five years. Pasture development conditions are generally good in the agro-pastoral zone. However, the overall fodder balance gives a supply of 3 million tonnes of dry matter against the 8 million tonnes estimated for the theoretical total needs of the resident livestock, leaving an overall forage deficit of about 5 million tonnes. The pastoral lean season is expected to be harsh and it is likely to start in February-March, about two months earlier than usual. This may affect animal’s body conditions, worsening animal-to-cereals terms of trade for pastoralists. Currently, the animal health situation is generally stable, with no major disease outbreaks reported.

On 15 June 2018, five new suspected EVD cases were reported in Bikoro Health Zone. Six laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously) tested negative. No new confirmed EVD cases and no new deaths were reported on the reporting date. Since 17 May 2018, no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case-patient in Iboko Health Zone developed illness on 2 June 2018 and was confirmed 6 June 2018.

Colombia: Floods - Apr 2018,"As a result of the registered rains between March 31 and April 2 of the current year, some 4,570 people (830 families) were affected by the overflow of the Magüí River in the municipality of the same name...; of this total, at least half corresponds to children and adolescents. The number could increase once the census is consolidated with the information obtained from rural areas. ([OCHA, 6 Apr 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2546864/))     

On 5 May, a collapse inside the third tunnel of the Hidroituango Dam project (Antioquia Department) increased the levels of the Cauca river in the area. On 12 May, a natural unblocking in the second tunnel produced a flash flood affecting Puerto Valdivia and Taraza municipalities. Following these events, 544 people were evacuated (250 in official shelters) and 60 houses destroyed...Further events in the dam, which is in risk of collapse, have led to the evacuation of more than 9 000 people. According to the authorities, there are around 180 000 people at high risk. ([ECHO, 18 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2610704/))     

On 14 May, the Antioquia State Government declared Public Calamity. The Antioquia Governor estimates that in the worst scenario of the dam's rupture, 113,000 people would be affected. There is a current state of maximum alert at locations downstream of the project on the Cauca riverbanks: Ituango, Briceño, Valdivia (Corregimiento Puerto Valdivia), Cáceres, Tarazá, Caucasia and Nechí. A preventive evacuation order was issued to the departments of Sucre (Majagual, Guaranda, San Marcos, Sucre, Caimito y San Benito de Abad), Córdoba (Ayapel) and Bolívar (Achí, Magangué y San Jacinto del Cauca).

Afghanistan: Drought - 2018-2019,"La Niña has had a devastating effect on this year’s planting season, with a rain, snow and sleet deficit of 70 per cent prevailing across most of the country. With last year’s wheat production already reported to be 57 per cent below the five-year average, the 2018 harvest is forecast to be even lower: down from 4.2 million metric tons to 3.5 million metric tons. ([OCHA, 25 Apr 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2574344))

Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could impact agricultural production.

In the past week, another 120,000 people have arrived in Qala-e-Naw City, Badghis, due to the drought. In Kandahar, assessment teams verified the arrival of 2,800 drought-displaced people from Badghis and Ghor and 1,400 in the district centre of Maiwand, Kandahar. The total displacement due to the drought has reached a total of 275,000 people, exceeding the number of people displaced by conflict in 2018 by 52,000 people. In Qala-e-Naw, partners are ramping up assistance across all sectors and are deploying additional staff, though the gaps remain significant. Further, WFP plans to further scale up food assistance in areas of origin to allow families to return to their villages, reaching up to 100 per cent of the population in the most affected districts. In Hilmand Province, IRC started a new project to assist 2,100 drought affected people. ([OCHA 9 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2780474))

Badghis, Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Hilmand, Nimroz, Uruzgan, Kubduz, Takhar, Herat, Ghor and Farah are among the worst affected provinces...The government launched a USD 100 million appeal in mid-April through MAIL for immediate livestock protection for an initial two months of assistance for fodder/feed support and an overall demand of USD 550 million for a 10 months fodder / feed support throughout the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. ([IFRC, 16 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2605364))    

In the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, nearly 15 million people rely on farming, livestock or labour opportunities in agriculture. Of these, an estimated 2 million people will become severely food insecure due to the drought. Humanitarian partners are ramping up their response across the country...trying to reach 1.4 million of the most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men struck by the drought. Partners urgently need $115 million; the majority of this amount will provide food support to help families through the lean season and to provide them with drinking water for six months. ([OCHA, 25 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2623134))

The Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) has been revised to to include response to the drought and now calls for $547 million. The additional funding will allow humanitarian partners to incorporate assistance to 1.4 million people mostly affected by the drought[.] ([OCHA, 31 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2665019/)). 

Food security outcomes in the agropastoral areas are worse than is typical during the spring and summer months. Livestock productivity and body conditions are below normal levels in many areas due to very poor rangeland conditions, leading to low income from livestock sales and limited household availability of livestock products. Most rangeland areas have received well below average rainfall amounts, except for localized parts of western, southwestern, and southeastern provinces. ([FEWS NET, 31 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2632519)) 

Although several significant precipitation events during late spring helped alleviate dryness across the country, late rainfall was not sufficient to mitigate seasonal dryness in many parts of the country, which is most severe in the northwest but also significant across much of the north, northeast, southwest and central provinces. Field reports confirm that area planted for rainfed wheat is less than that of last year due to dry soil conditions and the use of extended areas for grazing, while a significant proportion of planted rainfed areas may have reduced yields due to dryness. ([FEWS NET, 6 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2641394)). 

The intense drought between April and September is expected to further aggravate the already poor malnutrition status within the 20 affected provinces, and the impact may extend to December. As a result, an increase in acute malnutrition caseload between July and December 2018 is expected. In addition, the severity of acute malnutrition among children under five may get worse, resulting in cases that are more complicated. As of 19 July, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in magnitude and severity of acute malnutrition and disease will stretch the capacity of health facilities to provide treatment, and that in the medium to long-term, children will face heightened vulnerability to morbidity and mortality. ([WHO, 19 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2704584)). 

In Hirat City, Hirat, humanitarian teams identified more than 51,000 people who have recently migrated to the city from drought-affected areas in neighbouring Badghis and Ghor provinces. The families are living in dozens of sites on the outskirts of the cities in makeshift shelters. In Qala-e-Naw, Bagdhis, teams identified nearly 7,000 people who have moved from rural areas to the provincial capital due to the drought. Cash distributions have started for these displaced families. The Government has distributed wheat grain to 15,000 families in four districts of Badghis, and WFP is preparing to distribute 1,250 metric tons of food in two districts of the same province. ([OCHA, 23 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2709269)) 

Poor households in the northern areas will be the most affected by the drought due to reduced household wheat stocks and income from on-farm labor where food consumption deficits will continue through the next harvest (Spring 2019). Poor households in central areas of the country dependent on remittances from migrant workers in Iran are expected to see a decrease in remittances and further weakening of the Iranian rial (IRR) against the U.S. Dollar (USD) and Afghani (AFN) to drive low incomes. ([FEWS NET, 31 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2722969))

As of 6 August, approximately 4,000 people arrived in Qala-e-Naw, Badghis, during the past week, reportedly displaced by drought from Muqur district. In Kunduz Province, more than 10,000 people have reportedly been displaced between different districts due to the drought. ([OCHA, 6 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2730279))

As of 12 August, some 1,400 families reportedly arrived in the centre of Abkamari district, Badghis, from villages affected by the drought in the district. In Farah City, Farah, assessment teams identified nearly 600 people displaced by the drought from within the province. Further, around 280 displaced people were identified as having been displaced from their villages in Shahrak district, Ghor, due to the drought. In Qala-e-Naw, Badghis, authorities designated a new site for 1,700 families who arrived recently in the city due to the drought. ([OCHA, 12 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2742869))

The drought continues to force people from their rural homes to the urban centres in Badghis, Ghor and Hirat provinces where their number surpassed 100,000 since May, according to humanitarian partners. The situation of drought-induced IDPs in Hirat city, Hirat remains dire. In the past week, six children reportedly died in the informal sites due to sickness, in a fire accident and at birth. WASH, health and protection services on the sites are picking up, but there are large gaps notably of emergency shelter. DRC-DDG and UNICEF have started protection monitoring on sites housing some 35,000 people. ([OCHA, 19 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2751119))

An estimated 275,000 people have been displaced as a result of the drought in Afghanistan. Newly displaced people arriving in Hirat during the last week have been reported, but not confirmed. In response to the drought, WFP started food distributions for 47,000 people in rural areas of Ghor Province. ([OCHA, 17 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2789044))

In the first half of September, an estimated 120,000 people have been displaced from rural areas of Badghis to Qala-e-Naw as a result of drought. As of 20 September, an estimated 253,600 people are currently displaced from drought affected areas across the Western Region. A further 28,000 people displaced by the drought have returned to their homes in Muqur district of Badghis, in the last two weeks, upon assurances of food distributions in their home villages. Existing response capacity at more than a dozen sites in Qala-e-Naw and its surroundings is limited: around 42,000 people have insufficient access to safe drinking water and over 130,000 people have no access to sanitation facilities with people living in makeshift shelters. ([OCHA, 24 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2799229))

Due to drought, high levels of food assistance needs will persist through the start of the lean season. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and will contribute to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. The worst-affected households will likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter in. ([FEWS NET, 30 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2809559))

On 16 October, [UN] Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund...and [CERF] have allocated $34.6 million in emergency aid to support 2.2 million people affected by a severe drought. With these funds, 7 national NGOs, 15 international NGOs and 4 UN agencies will distribute food and seeds, maintain primary health services, provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, improve hygiene and sanitation, treat severe malnutrition, and help farmers protect their livestock. ([OCHA, 16 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2832709/))

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and will contribute to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. Poor household dependent on rainfed wheat production, particularly in northern, northeastern, and northwestern areas, are expected to experience difficulty meeting consumption requirements until next year’s spring harvest. The worst-affected households will likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter ([IFRC, 1 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2857678)).

According to the latest IPC report, Badghis is among the three provinces with IPC Phase 4 (emergency), whereas, Ghor, Hirat and Farah provinces are classified as IPC phase 3 (crisis). The most affected provinces with large-scale displacement are Badghis and Hirat provinces which accounts 74% of the total IDPs ([OCHA, 19 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2883893)).

In October-November, WFP reached nearly 1.6 million drought-affected people with food assistance in all 20 affected provinces, providing more than 27,000 mt of food and transferring over US$1.45 million cash assistance to the affected people. Meanwhile, prepositioning of food and nutrition supplies continues in remote areas in nine provinces, to cover the needs of 499,000 people (3,400 metric tons prepositioned in the last week of November). ([OCHA, 9 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2910508))

During 17 - 23 December, as part of the ongoing full-scale drought response, WFP and its partners reached 104,500 drought-affected people both in rural and urban areas of eight provinces with 720 (mt) of food and US$180,000 in cash transfers to cover food needs. In the first three weeks of December, WFP and partners assisted nearly 450,000 drought-affected people with some 3,750 (mt) of food and US$540,000 in cash transfers. ([OCHA, 23 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2930594))

As part of the ongoing full-scale drought response, WFP and its partners reached 162,000 drought-affected people both in rural and urban areas of eight provinces during 8 - 14 January 2019. This included food for more than 40,000 people in informal settlements in and around Qalae-Naw in Badghis, who were displaced due to the drought. In total, WFP and partners distributed more than 4,400 metric tons (mt) of food in Badakhshan, Badghis, Ghor, Helmand, Herat, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul and Takhar provinces. ([OCHA, 14 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2957284))

Afghan Red Crescent Society..conducted an emergency needs assessment in nine drought affected provinces in December 2018 and January 2019. The emergency needs assessment report indicated that the priority needs of the affected population, who are staying in rural areas and IDP camps, are food, water, health care and livelihood support. Almost 60 to 70 per cent of the water points are now dry. Most of the affected communities in province of the country have very low latrine coverage. The water treatment is equally low, at less than 10 per cent. ([IFRC, 17 Mar 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3038718))

As of 31 March, humanitarian partners have reached 4.4 million people affected by drought with support, 91 per cent of those targeted for assistance. Of those reached, 438,600 people are in areas of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. ([OCHA, 23 Apr 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3144713))

Food security outcomes across the country are most likely to continue to gradually improve as the main harvest begins in late May/early June. As a result, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are most likely to emerge. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are also most likely in areas still recovering from the drought with continued conflict preventing access to agricultural activities. ([FEWS Net, 31 May 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3153189))

As of 30 April, humanitarian partners have reached 4.8 million people affected by drought. Of those reached, 405,000 people are in places of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. ([OCHA, 29 May 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3166779))

According to WFP, the drought support is scaling down starting in April, which will transition to seasonal support at the end of June. ([WFP, 31 May 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3183664)).

As of 31 May, humanitarian partners have reached 4.9 million people affected by drought. Of those reached, 450,600 people are in places of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. ([OCHA, 23 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3184429))

Food security outcomes are anticipated to generally improve across the country from June to September 2019, due to the above average wheat harvest, favorable livestock prices, and high demand for agriculture labor during the harvest. Most poor households across the country are likely to face Minimal (IPC Phase 1) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2). Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to continue in displaced households, undocumented returnees and areas of
Badghis province which was significantly affected by last year’s drought and conflict. ([FEWS Net, 29 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3193229))

As of 8 July 2019, the impact of drought has heavily influenced population movement within Afghanistan and caused the displacement of 287,000 people primarily from the north-western and western regions. The sudden influx of over a quarter million people into the outskirts of Herat has led to the emergence of 19 vast and sprawling informal settlements. The food security and livelihoods situation has significantly deteriorated over the past months, driven mostly by the severe drought in 2018. An estimated 13.5 million people are severely food insecure and require emergency assistance. Twenty provinces of Afghanistan are food insecure and identified as having acute humanitarian food needs, health and WASH issues and their livelihoods. ([IFRC, 9 July 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3203614))

Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected to be widespread as a result of the harvest and many households access own foods. However, areas of Badghis where many households are still recovering from the drought, undocumented returnees, and displaced households are expected to continue to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). As winter starts in October/November across much of the country, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are most likely to emerge as many households are expected to rely on markets with below average incomes. ([FEWS Net, 31 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3240534))

In reviewing the situation, [FAO] stated that the deteriorating food security and livelihood situation has continued into in the latter half of 2019, driven mostly by the worst drought in a decade last year. The severe drought has affected more than two-thirds of the country and destroyed the agriculture sector. Despite reports of good harvests for 2019, FAO predicted that it will not be enough to alleviate food insecurities in the region. ([FAO, 16 Sep 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3305223))

Between August and October 2019, it is estimated that 10.23 million people (33% of the total population) are in severe acute food insecurity and require urgent humanitarian action. These include around 7.79 million people in a crisis situation (IPC Phase 3) and 2.43 million people in an emergency situation (IPC Phase 4). Around 10.37 million people are also in a stressed situation (IPC Phase 2) and require livelihood support. During the projection analysis period, from November 2019 to March 2020, around 11.30 million people (37% of the total population) are estimated to be likely to experience severe acute food insecurity, out of which an estimated 8.6 million people likely be in an emergency situation (IPC Phase 4). Furthermore around 9.45 million people will be in a stressed situation (IPC Phase 2). ([IPC, 30 Sep 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3393683))

Conflict and insecurity continue to disrupt livelihoods across most of the country with over 380,000 people displaced since the start of 2019. Additionally, over 440,000 people have returned from Iran and Pakistan to date in 2019. Most of the returned and internally displaced populations are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) as these households have limited ability to access labor markets. Moreover, poor households impacted by weak labor markets, and below average remittances in higher elevated areas of the country remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). The rest of the country is in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) as many households continue to consume own foods, although have below average incomes. ([FEWS Net, 26 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3412733/))

Reports state that humanitarian food assistance will be necessary through the upcoming winter to mitigate food consumption gaps and prevent malnutrition in Afghanistan, especially as up to 85 percent of the country’s food comes from irrigated farming. It is predicted that, due to the effects of the drought, the number of people experiencing crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity will rise to 14.3 million people between the period of November 2019 and March 2020. This is an increase by 113 percent over the same period a year previous, as per Flowminder 2020 population projections. ([OCHA, 20 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3451828)).

Many millions of people are still reeling from the crippling effects of the 2018-19 drought and struggling to recover. The cumulative impacts of decades of war, combined with recurrent natural disasters and chronic poverty, have resulted in crippling debt and depleted people’s capacity to cope with repeated shocks. Over 14 million people are projected to experience crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity, in the first quarter of 2020. Malnutrition is soaring, with over 3 million children and women acutely malnourished, requiring specialised nutrition supplies and medicines. ([OCHA, 7 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3472643))

According to the IOM, almost 11,000 undocumented Afghans returned from Iran and Pakistan, and 700 people have been newly displaced by conflict in January 2020. These populations are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity as they have lost their typical livelihood activities and have limited ability to enter the labor markets. Many poor households across the country are facing food consumption gaps as households have depleted their food stocks and face difficulty accessing income to purchase food. Many of these households are in the Central Highlands and Northeastern parts of the country with these areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are present in areas where households have access to remittances or labor opportunities although at below average levels. As winter progresses, more households are expected to rely on markets for food with below average purchasing power. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to emerge across parts of the country.

The Council of Ministers has declared a State of Emergency on Ambae Island. Approximately 750 people have lost their homes, 643 as a result of the volcanic ash, and 115 by landslides. The Council of Ministers has ordered the entire population to evacuate the island.  ([OCHA, 23 Apr 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2569244))

As of 27 April, there has been resistance to the mandatory evacuation plan over a 2-week period between 1 to 15 May. The Penama provincial government declared that they will purchase land on the West and East of Ambae to accommodate people who need to evacuate form the worst affected areas. The proportion of the population who will require on-/off-island assistance remains unclear, and it is anticipated that evacuated populations will require emergency shelter assistance and household items. ([IFRC, 27 Apr 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2577449/))

As of 15 May, the volcanic activity has decreased with reduced ashfall experienced during first two weeks of May. The ash has, however, increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities have been evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 112 families (469 persons) from southern Ambae have sought refuge in 10 host communities in the east, whilst 757 families (3,055 persons) from the northern communities are temporarily sheltering in Saint Patrick’s College and Torgil Training Center in the northeast. An undetermined number have voluntarily relocated to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands. ([UNICEF, 15 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2603094))

A state of emergency was in effect on the island of Ambae until 13 July as the activity of the Manaro Voui volcano remained unpredictable. On 7 June, the threat level of the Manaro Voui volcano is categorized as “major unrest state”, and was lowered from volcanic alert level three to level two; with the danger zone now limited to a 2 km radius from the active vent. Parts of Ambae Island have been blanketed with ash for weeks, and although volcanic activity has recently decreased, light ashfall continues to be experienced in some northern parts of the island. In previous weeks, the ashfall had increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two affected communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities left their homes and evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 2,000 residents remain displaced on Ambae living with host communities or in evactuation centres on the island, whilst around 800 people are known to have voluntarily left Ambae relocating to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands ([UNICEF, 15 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2603094)). 

As of 10 July, the Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 2 due to its continued and major unrest state. Observations have confirmed that the volcanic activity has been unstable since 20 June. On 1 July, the volcano emitted a column of ash which induced heavy to light ash fall driven by the prevailing trade wind at villages from North-West to West of Ambae Island and  the North-Eastern part of Santo Island . A small eruption scale in Lake Voui is continuing. ([Gov't of Fiji, 10 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2691664))

On 16 July, much of the east and north of Vanuatu's Ambae Island experienced heavy ashfall after the eruption from the volcano intensified, residents said ([RNZI, 17 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2699709)). A second state of emergency was declared by the Government of Vanuatu’s Council of Ministers (COM) from 26 July to 26 September 2018. In addition, an order was made to immediately evacuate all people in Ambae to nearby Maewo island. ([UNICEF, 6 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2733564))

As of 23 August, Ambae volcano remains in the minor eruption state at Volcanic Alert Level 3. The volcanic activity is likely to remain at the minor eruptive activity or decrease to a major level of unrest at any time. The Danger Zone for life safety is limited at 3 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. ([Gov't Vanuatu, 23 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2754619/)).

As of 21 September, Ambae volcano is in the major unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level is lowered to Level 2. The Danger Zone for life safety is now limited at 2 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. Observations in September 2018 confirm that the eruptive activity occurred in July until August has dropped. There is no explosions and volcanic cloud emitted are white colour, means only steam. A small scale eruption in Lake Voui has ceased. ([Gov't Vanuatu, 21 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2798309/))

Following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake which hit the Highlands Region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and affected an estimated 544,000 people in five provinces, assessment teams visited 38 displacement sites in the Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Provinces of PNG between 10–27 March 2018. Data was collected from key informants including councilors, village leaders, church leaders, teachers and healthcare workers. 

The assessments showed that the most urgent needs of the displaced populations were water and shelter first and foremost, as well as kitchen utensils and food. Displacement sites such as Lau, Timu and Levani located in Hela Province are extremely isolated and were identified to be in urgent need of food rations following the destruction of food gardens and the limited food supply available. Many of the affected populations also suffer from continued trauma as aftershocks of the earthquake continue to hit the region. [(IOM, 20 Apr 2018)](https://reliefweb.int/node/2581669)

The key social infrastructure assessment, primarily focusing on health and education facilities, concluded that total estimated cost of rehabilitating in Hela, Southern Highlands and Western provinces is approximately USD 105 million. Result of a mobile Vulnerability Assessment Mapping (mVAM) survey, conducted during 22 March to 12 April 2018, indicated that 14 per cent of 1,534 households contacted in affected areas were displaced.  Nine of 31 households in Local Level Governments (LLGs) surveyed experienced high or extreme food shortages, with the destruction of food gardens in these areas removing the main livelihood and food supply source for the majority of people.

of which 1,672 households are staying in eleven care centres while 10,089 households are staying with host communities according to the latest figures available from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM). Due to restricted humanitarian access, an operational planning group for land-based relief activities in Hela province was established on 16 May. The group is working closely with the PNG Government to identify down-scaled permissible locations based on latest information of the security situation in Hela province. Land-based relief operations in Hela are expected to resume incrementally from early June. [(Govt. PNG, OCHA & UN CT PNG, 28 May 2018)](https://reliefweb.int/node/2626109)

The access to remote locations and communication remains a significant challenge faced by all actors. As violent clashes in some communities are frequent, the restriction of movement has delayed, or prevented, aid from reaching certain locations. As of 29 May, humanitarian organizations temporarily have suspended operations in Hela province due to several security incidents.  Serious security concerns in some areas continue to hamper intervention. ([IFRC, 29 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2626804)).

Earthquake response activities in the Southern Highlands Province have been suspended after an outbreak of violence in the provincial capital, Mendi. Following the result of a national court decision to dismiss an election petition in favour of the incumbent Governor, protestors attacked multiple public and private buildings.

Mongolia: Dzud - Jan 2018,"In 2017, a prolonged period of severe dry weather between mid-May and end of July, intensified by extreme high temperatures in June, damaged large swatches of cropped areas and caused a severe deterioration of pastures and rangeland conditions. An estimated 80 percent of the country was affected by drought conditions. This resulted in severe yield and area losses of the 2017 crops...The 2017 wheat production is estimated at about 231 000 tonnes, almost half of last year’s high level and over 40 percent less than the five-year average...Drought also caused a severe deterioration of pasture conditions, which prevented livestock to gain fat stores and strengthen core muscle strength, critical to overcome the normally harsh winter/spring months. According to MoFALI data, as of November 2017, overall livestock body condition is 14 percent below average... Harsh winters following summer droughts significantly increase risks for herders to lose their animals. ([FAO/WFP, 22 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2390354)).

As of 20 December 2017, the dzud risk map for winter 2017-2018, published by National Agency of Meteorology and the Environmental Monitoring shows that about 40 percent of the country is at the extreme risk of dzud and about 20 percent of the country is at high risk of dzud. In order to reflect the evolving needs of affected population, to address the recommendation from the final evaluation of previous emergency appeal operation and with the additional funding from donors, MRCS and IFRC revised the operational plan and extended the timeframe. In addition to relief activities, the operation is now supporting Dzud preparedness and National society capacity building by taking account of close consultation with the affected population and relevant authorities.

According to the Malagasy authorities, as of 9 January, about 123,000 people had been directly or indirectly impacted by Tropical Cyclone Ava, with 24,800 people evacuated, 33 dead and 22 missing.
The cyclone damaged 19 health centres and affected 141 schools, including 77 classrooms used as shelter for displaced people. About 34,640 children are out of school.  
Road access to some south-eastern and southwestern parts of the country has been cut off. River levels have started to moderately decrease in Antananarivo and in the south-eastern coast.

More than 73,000 families in Chiapas and Oaxaca have received support for house reconstruction. ([UNICEF, 10 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2320814))

In November, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in Mexico City, Mexico State, Puebla, Oaxaca and Morelos concluded the medical, mental health and heath promotions activities that were launched in response to the emergency situations created by two major earthquakes in September.  
MSF provided 1,544 medical care consultations and 1,450 mental health consultations, while our health promotion activities reached 6,000 people. The organisation distributed nearly 150 tarpaulins for shelter and 200 kits containing basic tools for cooking, hygiene, cover and, in some cases, specific products for babies and toddlers. MSF also donated about 20 tents in some of the most affected communities. ([MSF, 8 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2366274))  

Three months after the earthquakes, most children living in the most affected municipalities in the five states have gradually returned to school and to their normal lives. UNICEF has developed an Early Recovery Plan to be implemented between January and June 2018. This plan includes actions on Education, Child Protection, Social Inclusion, Health and Nutrition, and WASH. Also, after several demands from the respective local governments, UNICEF ́s action in the early recovery phase will expand to the State of Mexico and Guerrero, also affected by the earthquakes. ([UNICEF, 19 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2385919))  

The Mexican Red Cross has sent more than 4,507 tons of humanitarian aid for the September earthquakes to the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, CDMX, Estado de México and Tlaxcala, which has benefited more than one million 126 a thousand people. This humanitarian aid has been distributed among 661 communities that were affected.  ([Mexican Red Cross, 21 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2390299))

South Sudan: Floods - Sep 2017,"According to the State Ministry of Health, it is estimated that over 11, 000 people have been affected by flooding caused by heavy rainfall in 11 payams of Aweil North and Aweil West of former Northern Bahr el Ghazal State. More flooding also caused some deaths and injuries and has deeply affected the daily lives of over 650 households in eight villages of Bunj payam, Maban County, Upper Nile State. ([WHO, 18 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2226554))    

Heavy rains and floods have affected several parts of South Sudan, including Aweil North, Aweil East, Raja, and Maban counties; and parts of Eastern and western Equatoria. Thousands of people have been displaced while several roads have been washed away, making transport difficult. In addition, farmlands have been destroyed, which is likely to impact on the expected harvest, worsening the food security situation next year. ([WHO, 28 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2250274))    

In September, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Jonglei states experienced flooding as a result of heavy rains. UNICEF together with partners responded to over 20,000 households affected by the flooding in Northern Bahr el Ghazal with provision of supplies, including household water treatment products and water containers. However, the WASH sector continues to face a significant funding gap (54 per cent). ([UNICEF, 30 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2252449))    

Torrential rain has caused major damage across the region with the combination of a stream bursting its banks and the overflow from the Kengen, Lothila and Kubal rivers causing massive floods across Pibor. 
More than 2000 households are now in need of urgent assistance. The situation remains particularly volatile for eight counties located along the river. Latilak, Babuzen, Vertek, Likuangole, Pochalla, Ajwara, Pibor North and South Counties have seen their farms wiped out and children are unable to get to school...If water continues to rise, access to the area via the Pibor airstrip could be affected. The state legislative assembly has been damaged and many government officials have been cut off from their offices. The acting Governor of Boma, Omot Ogul Abai, is appealing for urgent assistance.

At least 14 people have died in **Dominica**, with the number of fatalities expected to rise as large areas of the island remain inaccessible after category 5 Hurricane Maria decimated the island’s east coast, according to initial reports from the ground. At least 80 per cent of the island’s population has been affected and needs support with shelter and water, according to CDEMA. ([OCHA, 21 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2233129/))   

As of 19 September, hundreds of people were evacuated in **Guadeloupe, Dominica and Martinique**. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for more than 11,900 people in Puerto Rico (ECHO 19/09/2017). Maria made landfall in Dominica on September 19 and in Puerto Rico on 20 September. As of October 10, at least 96 people are confirmed to have been killed: 51 in Puerto Rico, 30 in Dominica, five in the Dominican Republic, four in the contiguous United States, three in Haiti, two in Guadeloupe, and one in the US Virgin Islands. 39,000 children are in need of assistance in countries affected by hurricanes Irma and Maria, more than a quarter of them are under five (UNICEF 18/10/2017) ([ACAPS, 2 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2305829/))   

On 29 September, UN and partners launched a [Flash Appeal](https://reliefweb.int/node/2247319) for $31.1 million to support relief and early recovery efforts in Dominica till the end of 2017. The UN has allocated US$3 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to address the urgent needs of Dominica’s people. There is a steady flow of food into the country. More than 15.5 metric ton of food and 190,000 litres water has been delivered. Supermarkets are expected to open this week. Government expects to have access to all parts of the country later this week. Provision of potable water to the west coast to be prioritized following serious concerns over communicable diseases.

As of 14 November, in **Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Dominica**, approximately 70 per cent of the population has access to restored water services, while power services coverage ranges from 70 per cent in Turk and Caicos Islands (TCI) to 10 percent in Dominica. There has also been a notable reduction in the number of displaced people living in official shelters in BVI and Dominica. In Dominica, this includes a 60 per cent decrease over the last few weeks.  
The majority of children in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, and Turk and Caicos Islands have now gone back to school, with all public schools reopening. However, in Dominica just around a third of national schools were open as of 10 November, and 87 per cent of children living in collective shelters still do not have access to any type of education, and are missing out on valuable months of their schooling, which could have implications on the quality of their education. ([UNICEF, 14 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2331694/))    

For **Dominica**, The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment concluded that Hurricane Maria resulted in total damages of EC$2.51 billion (US$931 million) and losses of EC$1.03 billion (US$382 million), which amounts to 226 percent of 2016 gross domestic product (GDP). The identified recovery needs for reconstruction and resilience interventions, incorporating the principle of ‘building back better’ (BBB) where possible, amount to EC$3.69 billion (US$1.37 billion). ([Gov't of Dominica, 15 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2433484/))  

The European Commission has provided €500,000 to [UNICEF] to support Dominica’s education sector in the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria last September...The EU-UNICEF project aims to fill this gap. The 11-month project will target 1,500 primary school children in the 20 most severely damaged schools. Each school will get a library and a range of teaching materials, including text books and workbooks. ([ECHO/UNICEF, 18 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2424019/))  

At almost four months after Hurricane Maria hit Dominica, only around 10 per cent of people, mainly in the cities of Roseau and Portsmouth, have access to electricity. The Dominica Electricity Services reported that services are in process of being restored throughout the island. Diverse foodstuffs have reappeared on the markets, shops are reopening, most public schools have reopened, and 30 out of 43 damaged water systems have been provisionally repaired. The curfew was lifted in Roseau on 8 December. Nevertheless, Dominica remains seriously impacted. Over 80 percent of houses still have inadequate roofing, many children have not yet returned to school and a sizeable portion of the population is highly vulnerable due to the loss of their main source of livelihoods. To date, 8 collection centres are still open. ([IFRC, 29 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2438024/))    

The humanitarian actors have mostly transitioned from relief activities to recovery, and coordination mechanisms are reflecting this shift. A growing number of ministries and stakeholders take part in sector coordination mechanisms, which is conducive to more comprehensive and complementary action plans. Finally, the Ministry of Planning has taken over multi-sector coordination from the Dominican government’s Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).

A new focus of yellow fever outbreak has been confirmed in Edo State, Nigeria, following the large outbreak that started in September 2017 up to late-March 2018. While Nigeria introduced yellow fever vaccine into routine immunization in September 2016, the country remains vulnerable to the disease...In Edo State, yellow fever vaccination coverage in children below one year of age is about 69% and approximately 60% in the rest of the population, leaving a significant number of people susceptible to the disease. The current outbreak has occurred close to the state capital, Benin city, which is moderately cosmopolitan, with high population movements due to trade. An influx of persons with low immunity to yellow fever coming from other parts of the country, Europe and America into Edo state for the Christmas holidays is expected. All these underlying issues are significant, calling for the rapid implementation of the upcoming reactive vaccination campaign. ([WHO, 14 Dec 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2920023/))

Madagascar: Plague Outbreak - Sep 2017,"On 13 September 2017, the WHO was notified of an outbreak of pulmonary plague in Madagascar. The outbreak was detected on 11 September 2017. As of 14 September 2017, a total of 28 cases, including five deaths (case fatality rate 17.8%) have been reported since the initial case was detected on 27 August 2017. Two cases have been confirmed by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM).

Analamanga Region in central Madagascar has been the most affected, with 68% of all recorded cases. Since the beginning of this outbreak, the vast majority of cases have been treated and have recovered. As of 24 November 2017, only 11 people were hospitalized for plague. There has been no international spread outside the country. ([WHO, 27 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2347079/))

On Monday, 27 November the Ministry of Health of Madagascar officially announced the containment of the acute urban pneumonic plague outbreak. However, because plague is endemic in Madagascar and the plague season lasts from September to April, more cases of bubonic and sporadic pneumonic plague are expected to be reported until April 2018. ([WHO, 04 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2358099/))

By the end of April 2018, some 2,671 cases of the plague had been recorded since the first case of the plague season was reported in August 2017, including at least 239 deaths. Although the plague is endemic in Madagascar, the number of cases in the 2017-2018 season is at least six times the annual average of around 400 cases, the outbreak began earlier than usual, and the predominance of pneumonic plague in urban areas this season differs from the usual trend of bubonic plague in rural areas. Since the official announcement of the containment of the urban pneumonic plague outbreak on 27 November 2017, 194 cases of plague, bubonic (60) and pneumonic (128), have been reported, including 23 deaths.

A national response plan for the cVDPV2 outbreak and a micro plan for rural Deir-ez-Zoir campaigns have been developed to conduct two immunization rounds in Deir-ez-Zor with monovalent oral polio vaccine type-2 (mOPV2 targeting 328,000 children under five years of age and Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) will be used in the secondround targeting 114,500 children aged between 2-24 months). ([OCHA, 26 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2098009)) 

Two new cases of [cVDPV2] were reported in the past week, bringing the total of cVDPV2 cases to 24...Although access to Deir-Al-Zour is compromised due to insecurity, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, two campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using the bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV). However, only limited coverage was possible through these campaigns.  In response to the isolation of cVDPV2 from Raqua governorate, the Syrian Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF is considering adding the area to the outbreak response. This is under discussion due to ongoing military operations.  ([GPEI, 4 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2110609))  

One of the previously-reported cases from Raqua, on re-testing, has been confirmed as negative for circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), and has been removed from the list of cases. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is now 23 (22 from Deir-Al-Zour and one from Raqua). ([GPEI, 12 July 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2121779))

Monovalent type-2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) was shipped with 350 vaccine carriers dispatched by MoH to Deir Ez-Zor governorate on 11 July to prepare for the first immunization campaign in the area. An mOPV2 campaign in affected areas of Raqqa governorate is now planned. ([WHO, 12 July 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2119089))

Adding Raqqa Governorate to the outbreak response will increase the target population by almost 120,000 children under 5 years of age. In addition to the outbreak, sector partners are increasingly concerned about limited capacities to provide adequate trauma care particularly in areas close to hostilities. Discussions are taking place amongst health partners seeking to mobilize additional resources and capacities to respond to needs. ([OCHA, 14 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2135079))

Guatemala: Floods and Landslides - Jun 2017,"The rainy season of 2017 has begun in many regions of the country and to date -CONRED-, has responded to 142 incidents that have directly and indirectly affected 144,415 people nationwide.

In 20 departments of the country, actions have been taken to care for those affected - only Santa Rosa and Chimaltenango have reported no major incidents. The departments where incidents have been recorded for the rainy season are Guatemala with 18 incidents; Quiché with 17 incidents; as well as 10 incidents in San Marcos, 10 in Huehuetenango and another 10 in the department of Jutiapa. The incidents which have occurred were floods, landslides and landslides.

The rainy season will not end until November, and so far 144,415 people have been affected. There have been 1,470 evacuees, 938 victims, 667 people have been sheltered, and 16 people have reportedly died in the current rainy season 2017. ([Gov't of Guatemala, 03 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2106879))

Between 2-3 September, floods were reported in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén and Suchitepéquez, with 2,466 people affected and damage in 438 homes, according to damage assessments and needs analysis carried out by institutions of the National Coordinating System for Disaster Reduction ([Gov't of Guatemala, 05 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2201339))

According to the Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology National Institute (INSIVUMEH), heavy rainfall on 18 September of 2017, caused floodings throughout Guatemala, particularly in the north-western region of the country. Floods were registered in the municipalities of San Felipe, Santa Cruz Muluá, San Martín Zapotitlán, Mazatenango’s urban centre, Colotenango’s urban centre, Calle de la Cruz, Callejón 10, Campo Borrayo, and the cantons of Icán, La otra banda and Tulula, among other areas. When the Guatemalan Red Cross Damage Analysis and Needs Assessment (DANA) teams were deployed to the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, the departmental delegate from CONRED reported that the flooding affected 629 people, forced 164 people to evacuate from their homes and 97 people to seek shelter in collective centres, damaged 68 roads and impacted 1 bridge in the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez.  

In the departments of Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu, floods have damaged homes, crops and household goods. Around 2,016 families are affected according to local authorities.  

The flood-stricken families preferred to find their own shelter since the collective centres assigned by local authorities do not have electricity, running water, toilets, showers or kitchens, and are far away from people’s homes; the loss of bedding, clothing, blankets and the necessary tools for their livelihoods, among other items has also prompted affected people to seek their own shelter to safeguard the few belongings they still have left.    

Local authorities have declared an orange level for the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez to be able to provide emergency assistance to the affected areas, and on September 27 2017, CONRED declared Red Alert in Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, to provide assistance to the local emergencies.  ([IFRC, 2 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2250524))   

Continuous rains have fallen in the department of Alta Verapaz for the entire month of October 2017, affecting 62 rural and urban communities in 8 municipalities due to increased water levels and the overflow of the Cahabón, Chixoy, Icbolay and Polochic Rivers.  
The heavy rains that continue to pound the area are compounded by the presence of an easterly wave, the arrival of Tropical Storm Selma, increased humidity saturation levels and swollen rivers that threaten to impact further already flooded areas. As of 31 October 2017, 13 collective centres have been opened to house more than 999 people, whose homes were directly affected.  
Alta Verapaz is one of the largest maize producers in Guatemala, accounting for 10 per cent of the total production in the country; however, crops are being lost to the flooding, which puts small and medium-sized farmers’ food security at risk for the next few months, according to information provided by the Guatemalan Red Cross (GRC) branch in Cobán. Per official reports, 450 hectares owned by 1,097 families have been affected in the municipality of Chisec, Raxruhá and Panzós. ([IFRC, 10 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2320739/))

Nepal: Floods and Landslides - Jun 2017,"Since 1 June, 37 of the 75 districts in Nepal have been impacted by floods and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains. Solukhumbu and Palpa districts were particularly affected by the combined effects  of flooding, landslides and heavy monsoon rains. To date, authorities confirmed at least 34 deaths. The Government has provided cash grants to families in Saptari District whose houses were destroyed by the floods. A rapid needs assessment is ongoing in Saptari. ([OCHA, 17 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2125374))

Red Cross volunteers and emergency teams are searching for survivors as flash floods and landslides have submerged thousands of homes in several parts of Nepal, mostly in the south of the country. The floods and landslides have claimed at least 53 lives over the past three days, in the Terai region bordering India and other areas of Nepal, according to the Government of Nepal. Dozens more are missing or injured. “Monsoon rains and floods in the past two weeks have affected more than 100,000 people. First aid and relief supplies have been provided around the clock by hundreds of volunteers from the Nepal Red Cross Society,” said Dev Ratna Dhakhwa, Secretary General, Nepal Red Cross Society. ([IFRC, 13 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2167419))

Due to continuous rainfall in different parts of the country, approximately 100,000 people in 31 districts have been affected by the floods and landslides in the last two weeks. According to the Nepal Red Cross Initial Rapid Assessment (IRA) reports received from the affected districts as of 13 August 2017, a total of 27,861 families (139,300 people) have been affected, of which 6,247 families (47,350 people) are displaced. Some 2,964 houses are completed destroyed and 8,344 are partially damaged. The report indicates that 64 people are confirmed dead; 16 people are still missing; and 44 people have been injured. The numbers have been increasing day by day; this is likely to continue as some of the affected areas are challenging to access. NRCS has already deployed 448 Red Cross volunteers including District Disaster Response Team (DDRT) members, trained First Aid and National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) members on the ground for immediate response. ([IFRC, 14 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2170809))  

As of 16 August, 18,320 families are confirmed to have been displaced, and 75,000 families are affected by the flooding. More than 100,000 people have been rescued by formal and informal search and rescue. There have been 123 recorded deaths, according to Nepal's Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). Water levels in flood-affected areas have been gradually receding as the rainfall has significantly decreased or stopped in most parts of the country. However, the number of affected districts has increased to 35 (out of 75 districts nationwide); Morang, Sunsari, Siraha, Rautahat, Mahottari, Dhanusa, Sindhuli, Bara, Parsa, Dang, Banke and Bardiya are among the worst hit districts. The Ministry of Home Affairs says that more than 80 percent of land in the Tarai has been inundated. Hydro-meteorological stations in Banke, Chitwan and Makwanpur recorded the heaviest rainfall in 60 years. Moderate to heavy rains have been forecast across Nepal for the coming days. Significant access challenges remain: Biratnagar airport remains closed, and other basic services such as transport routes, electric power and drinking water supplies, and communications are reportedly still disrupted. ([UN RC, 16 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2173429))

As of 18 August, the districts with the highest numbers of people affected by the floods are: Saptari, Rautahat, Mahottari, Siraha, Baridya, Sunsari, Banke, Chitwan, Morang, Sarlahi, Kailali and Jhapa. Across all affected districts, 44,683 families have been displaced; at least 383 schools and learning centres are being used as temporary shelters. Flood waters are receding; however, with access improving and a better understanding of the impact and damage caused by the floods, the overall number of affected people continues to rise. There are significant concerns about the possibility of disease outbreaks after the floods, with affected people facing difficulties in accessing adequate health care. ([UN RC, 18 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2178344/))

As of 21 August, Initial Rapid Assessments (IRA) have been completed in 24 districts. A total of 1.7 million people are reported to be affected, of whom nearly 461,000 people, or 91,400 families, have been displaced from their homes. While many roads have reopened and Biratnagar airport is now operational during daylight, according to data from the Nepal Food Security Monitoring System, more than 50 villages remain inaccessible by road.

Tropical Cyclone Mora - May 2017,"Severe Cyclonic Storm Mora made landfall in **Bangladesh** on 30 May 2017. The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)-Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) estimates that 10,074,699 people were living in regions that were exposed to wind speeds of 120 km/h or more, and that some districts near Cox’s Bazaar and Chittagong were hit with gusts that topped 130 km/h. 

There were at least six lives lost, as well as 136 people injured, according to the National Health Crisis Management Centre and Control Room of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Government sources have estimated that approximately 52,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 260,000 people in possible need of shelter. In particular, Cox’s Bazaar district was heavily hit, with approximately 17,000 residences damaged. Housing for undocumented Myanmar nationals near Cox’s Bazaar was severely damaged. Rohingya refugees are currently without reliable shelter, food, and fuel. ([UN RC, 31 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2055354))

An estimated 3.3 million people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone MORA, which made landfall in Chittagong Division on 30 May...As of 3 June, 540,000 people are estimated to require humanitarian assistance. The most severely affected area has been Cox’s Bazar, where more than 300,000 Rohingya refugees and Undocumented Myanmar Nationals are residing. Six Rohingya settlements in the area have reportedly been severely affected, with up to 70 per cent of shelters as well as latrines, clinics and other infrastructure damaged. Agencies working in Cox’s Bazar and other affected areas, are providing assistance in support of the Government response. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2060694))

The storm damaged all UNICEF-supported Child Friendly Spaces in Cox's Bazar. These facilities had been supporting 13,437 children in makeshift settlements and host communities. According to UNICEF, children are at risk of exploitation, abuse and violation, as they are taking shelter with people who are not their immediate family members. Caregivers are busy collecting relief and restoring livelihoods; as a result, children are often left unattended for long periods. This could increase their vulnerability and exposure to risks. ([UNICEF, 20 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2086224/))

According to data made available by the Government of Bangladesh, some 52,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed, leaving more than 200,000 people displaced. The worst-hit area is Cox’s Bazar district. ([ECHO, 6 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2108974))

In the IDP camps in central Rakhine State, hundreds of shelters, temporary learning spaces and latrines also suffered damage or collapsed due to the strong winds. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2060694))

As of 13 June, official estimates for the total number of people affected in Myanmar were not yet available. Complicating the issue are the decades of protracted tension and communal violence in Rakhine state, where the cyclone hit. Access to some areas, including by humanitarian organizations, remains constricted. Although authorities have allowed some organizations to conduct needs assessments in Maungdaw and Buthidaung, the data is still to be verified and a comprehensive assessment has not been conducted, according to the IFRC. As of 13 June, distribution of NFIs had not yet started in these townships; authorities continued to invoke security concerns to postpone access.

([FAO, 30 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2052219))

Fall armyworm, which has caused extensive damage to maize crops in southern Africa, has spread to the east and has worsened the situation. In **Kenya**, the pest has so far affected about 200 000 hectares of crops, and in Uganda more than half the country's 111 districts are affected.

Despite containment efforts, fall armyworm (FAW) - an insect native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas—is expected to remain a threat to food insecurity in the **Horn of Africa** in 2018. ([OCHA, 29 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2436729))

**South Sudan**'s Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, with support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) developed a five-year plan for sustainable management and control of Fall Armyworm in the country.  ([FAO, 27 Sep 2018 ](https://reliefweb.int/node/2805074))

In **Uganda**, Fall Army Worm incidence during the 2019 first season is expected at levels comparable to the 2018 first season. However, the limited tendency of FAW to spread amidst above-average rainfall, coupled with some prevention efforts by the local government and farmers, could result in a significant decrease in levels of infestation and damage.

The effects of the fall armyworm (FAW) in **Kenya** were ultimately minimal, given that farmers’ use of integrated pest management combined with heavy rainfall from April onward. ([FEWSNET/WFP, 31 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3466883))

There is currently an infestation of the FAW in **Ethiopia's** East Wollega of Oromia region, and the North Shewa zone of Amhara region.Around 1,250 hectares of maize has been affected, and there is a risk it will continue to spread. The impact of the FAW on crops in conjunction with destruction caused by desert locusts will likely negatively impact agricultural production and heighten pre-existing food insecurity. ([ACAPS, 15 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3396748))

In 2018, **Ethiopia's** Ministry of Agriculture and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that the FAW caused an estimated 35% reduction in crop yields in Meher seasonal production, affecting more than 150,000 out of 770,000 hectares infested across the country. ([IPC, 20 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3403688))

The South department is the most affected. Initial estimates indicate 4 deaths, 15 homes destroyed, and nearly 10,000 homes that could have been damaged in the South Department. According to the Delegate of the Department of the South, 80% of the spring harvest could have been destroyed.  Six communes - Chantal, Les Anglais, Chardonnieres, Les Coteaux, Port-à-Piment and Tiburon - have been inaccessible since April 23 due to the severe erosion of the road linking Port Salut and the west coast, hindering access. The humanitarian community has deployed teams to conduct a first multi-sectorial needs assessment in the 12 most affected municipalities.The Departmental Delegation of the South estimates that 350,000 people have been affected.

Niger: Hepatitis E Outbreak - Apr 2017,"The Ministry of Health on 19 April declared an outbreak of Hepatitis E that has killed 25 among 86 infected people. Medical assistance and preventive measures are ongoing to curb the disease which is mostly transmitted through contaminated water. [(OCHA, 24 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2002499))

The current outbreak in Niger is closely linked to an unclean water supply and hygiene and sanitation facilities for the 240,000 people who are currently displaced in Diffa. This is a particularly vulnerable population that for years has been suffering the consequences of the conflict between Boko Haram and armies in the region....To contain the outbreak, MSF has been working with the Ministry of Health for several weeks...Additionally, MSF has significantly increased its water and sanitation activities in Kitchendi, Garin Wazan and Toumour villages, where around 135,000 people have settled—the vast majority of which are displaced. The organization also distributed water chlorination tablets, soap and new jerrycans for 16,800 families in these villages. So far, more than 27,900 gallons of water have been treated and jerrycans being used in the community have been cleaned to prevent the spread of the disease.  [(MSF, 26 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2004829))

There is a risk that the outbreak will intensify. New cases are expected to continue to emerge in new health districts in the region. Diffa region is prone to rapid propagation of the disease due to the prevalent underlying factors, such as limited access to safe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices. The region is inhabited by vulnerable populations, such as refugees, IDPs, and returnees who are at risk of contracting the disease due to their living conditions. The forthcoming rainy season, from June to September, is likely to increase the spread of the disease to neighbouring regions, and will further exacerbate WASH needs among affected populations.

According to preliminary assessment conducted by Rwanda Red Cross staff and volunteers, an estimated 675 people (135 households) have been affected by heavy wind and storms that caused four people to be injured. The affected families are currently accommodated in the nearby communities after their houses were damaged and household materials and shelters destroyed. The affected population were left without basic needs such as food and cloth. Household beddings were also destroyed, creating the need for distribution of blankets, sleeping mats and other Non Food items (NFIs). It has been reported that an estimated 14 hectares of mixed crops were destroyed. As a result, a lack of access to foodstuffs presents a situation that may result in short term food insecurity, especially for children under-five, lactating mothers and elderly people.

The malaria outbreak situation in Burundi continues unabated with intense transmission causing high morbidity and mortality. The disease trend has been increasing in the past 10 weeks. In week 25 (week ending 25 June 2017), 173,355 clinical cases of malaria including 102 deaths (case fatality rate 0.06%) 
have been reported, compared to 170,048 cases and 61 deaths (case fatality rate 0.04%) reported in week 24. Since the beginning of 2017, 4,376,804 cases including 1,996 deaths (case fatality rate 0.05%) have been reported, as of 25 June 2017. Meanwhile, a total of 8,169,484 cases and 3,826 deaths (case fatality rate 0.05%) were registered in 2016. While the entire country is reporting a high 
burden of malaria, the northern, central and eastern regions are most affected. Ten out of 18 provinces in the country have attained the epidemic threshold, namely Karusi, Gitega, Muyinga, Kirundo, Kayanza, Ngozi, Bubanza, Cankuzo, Cibitoke, and Ruyigi. The 10 provinces represent 63% of the population at risk. With an incidence rate of 51.9%, malaria has been the leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality in Burundi. ([WHO, 7 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2115619))

The outbreak of malaria in Burundi has shown marked improvement in the last weeks, though the overall situation remains serious. The incidence started declining after attaining the latest peak in week 26, during which 175 755 cases including 71 deaths were reported. In week 29 (week ending 23 July 2017), 131 566 clinical cases of malaria including 68 deaths (case fatality rate of 0.05%) were reported, compared to 152 137 cases with 68 deaths registered in week 28. These figures, however, are still much higher than last year, when 109 496 cases with 62 deaths were reported in week 28 of 2016. Since the beginning of 2017, a total of 4 864 976 clinical cases of malaria including 2 205 deaths (case fatality rate 0.05%) have been registered across the country. While the entire country is reporting a high burden of malaria, the northern, central and eastern regions are most affected. Ten out of 18 provinces
in the country are in epidemic phase, namely Karusi, Gitega, Muyinga, Kirundo, Kayanza, Ngozi, Bubanza, Cankuzo, Cibitoke and Ruyigi. ([WHO, 11 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2168619))   

The number of malaria cases is decreasing (6,891,291 cases with 3,017 deaths) dropping under the, same time last year. Malaria cases usually increase by the end of the year due to the rainy season. This demonstrates the positive impact of the response measures implemented by partners.

West Africa: Armyworm Infestation - Mar 2017,"In **DR Congo**, since mid-December 2016, fall armyworms have destroyed thousands of hectares of maize and rice crops in the southeastern provinces Haut-Katanga, Haut-Lomami, Lualaba, Tanganyika and Sud Kivu (OCHA 15/02/2017). 63,000 hectares have been destroyed, which represents over 80% of maize production in the territories along the Zambian border (OCHA 15/02/2017; Straitstimes 26/02/2017). Taking into account the speed at which the worms spread, it is highly likely that other neighbouring provinces, especially Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Maniema and Kasai, are already affected. The extent of the spread would result in a significant impact on the local corn production (FEWSNET 28/02/2017).[(ACAPS, 23 Mar 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1956929))      
As of August 2017, the spread of fall armyworms has destroyed crops in 50 out of the country’s 145 territories. Between 50 to 80 percent of people in some of the areas affected by hunger struggle to make ends meet and to have something to eat. [(WFP, FAO, 14 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2168224))        
The number of acutely food insecure people from June to December 2017 has risen by almost 2 million since the same period in 2016. Conflict is causing widespread insecurity and population displacements in North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, Haut-Katanga and Kasai provinces. As of October 2017, 3.9 million people were internally displaced, more than 1.3 million in Kasai. Many people are eating little more than a meal a day – typically just maize or cassava root and leaves. Crops have been destroyed, production areas and market routes cut off, huge numbers of farmers displaced and planting areas severely reduced. Crop production has been affected by pest attacks such as the Fall Armyworm, which has a ected more than 80 territories. The depreciation of the local currency has resulted in more expensive and reduced imports. This, combined with limited domestic food supplies, has pushed up cereal prices. ([FAO, 16 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/node/2417944))          
Conflict related reduction in area planted as well as destruction from the Fall Army Worm (FAW) infestation are expected to contribute towards below average 2017 crop. Both factors will likely remain relevant through the early part of 2018 and consequently result in weak expectations for 2018 harvests. ([FEWS, 31 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/node/2443474))      

In **Ghana**, armyworms have ravaged around 1.4 million hectares of maize and cowpea plantations in six regions (Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Western, Eastern and the Northern). In Ashanti, some 6,400 hectares of cocoa farms have also been affected. Although the infestations occur every year, experts say that this year’s outbreak is unprecedented and have urged quick action to curb further destruction as food security and livelihoods of several households is threatened. Officials from the National Disaster Management Organisation have begun distributing pesticides and a national taskforce has been set up to oversee the control of the infestation. [(OCHA, 22 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2040989))  

In **Cameroon**, as of late August, the Ministry of Agriculture  informed that the fall armyworm pest had infested 6 of the central African state’s 10 regions. Armyworms have been a serious threat to food security in the country because cereals like maize, sorghum, rice and legume plants like cow-pea, peanuts and beans are increasingly being attacked every day. ([VOA, 29 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2192779))    

In **Nigeria**, on 5 September, FAO and the Government signed a Technical Cooperation Agreement to curtail Fall Armyworm infestation, as Minister of Agriculture appealed for enhanced FAO support to manage crop diseases in Nigeria. The objective of the TCP includes the establishment of capacities to detect, monitor and control the FAW infestation in maize production. The project is expected to improve national capacities for Fall Armyworm surveillance and monitoring in affected areas, the establishment of Public Awareness on FAW, strengthen national capacities for FAW management, restore productive capacity and enhance livelihood in the worst affected households.

FAO has conducted a sub-regional FAW ToT in Abuja, Nigeria on  5 - 10 September 2017 to increase the skills and knowledge of national plant protection and  extension  experts  and  FFS  practitioners  (Master  trainers  and  facilitators)  on FAW  in  Western  Africa.  The  trained  will  in  turn  train  other  staff  and  farmers  on management  of  the  pest  in  their  respective  countries.

Temperatures have fallen rapidly, reach as low as -13 degrees Celsius in high altitude areas, and between -2 and 0 degrees Celsius in the interior of the country. Regions in the east, north and south have been particularly affected. These low temperatures were due to a mass flow of polar air from the Arctic to Eastern Europe and North Africa. The national services of meteorology directorate have confirmed that intense cold conditions are set to continue.

Under royal instructions, and in response to the intense cold spell, the Ministry of the Interior and all external services and military services have launched a special programme of solidarity for the population groups heavily affected by the cold wave, especially mountainous, remote areas and enclosed douars (village communities). This aid programme has already been launched in some heavily affected areas, with some families having already received blankets and food and appropriate equipment for the winter.

This wave of freezing conditions and snow has also caused economic losses and livelihoods due to the isolation of several areas. In addition, traffic paralyzed as well by cutting roads reduced supplies to certain remote communities ...

In addition, cases are being investigated in the states of Bahía, Goias and Tocantis. According to epidemiological report number 29 from Brazil's Ministry of Health, 1,431 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported 1 December, 2016 to 10 March 2017; of these cases 379 (26.50 per cent) were confirmed, 125 (8.73 per cent) were ruled out and 927 (64.77 per cent) are still under investigation. The total number of suspected and confirmed cases is the highest that has been registered in the country since 2000 according to the WHO, and the vector poses a risk of spreading the disease to other parts of Brazil and other neighbouring countries in South America. ([IFRC, 21 Mar 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1951669))     
According to the last epidemiological report from the Ministry of Health dated 31 May 2017, the distribution of cases and deaths have doubled. The report further states that 3,240 suspected cases of wild-type yellow fever were reported, of which 792 were confirmed (24.5 per cent), 519 are still being studied (16 per cent), and 1,929 (59.5 per cent) were ruled out (see chart), with a fatality rate of 34.5 per cent.

Southern Africa: Armyworm Infestation - Jan 2017,"Reports from the Zambia Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit indicate that as of 9 January 2017, close to 130,000 ha planted to maize had been affected by a severe outbreak of the *Fall Armyworm*, which is new to the southern African region. Of the affected area, over 68,000 ha may require re-planting. Government efforts to control the outbreak are underway...With 94% of the country’s districts affected in varying degrees, including several districts bordering Zambia’s eight neighbours in the SADC region, vigilant region-wide monitoring activities are required. ([SADC, 13 Jan 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1858434))

A fall armyworm outbreak, the first emergence of the pest in southern Africa, is causing considerable crop damage in some countries. If the pest damage aggravates, it could dampen prospects for good crop harvests that is anticipated in the current farming season. Maize, a staple food in the region, has been the most affected, as well as other cereals including sorghum, millet and wheat. Southern Africa is reeling from the effects of two consecutive years of El Niño-induced drought that affected over 40 million people, reduced food availability by 15 percent and caused a cereal deficit of 9 million tonnes. ([FAO, 3 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1888559))

Sixteen East and Southern African countries agreed on 16 February on urgent plans of action aimed at boosting the region’s capacity to manage emerging crop pests and livestock diseases, including armyworm and avian influenza ... Zambia has reported that almost 90 000 hectares of maize have been affected, forcing farmers to replant their crops. In Malawi some 17 000 hectares have so far been affected while in Namibia, approximately 50 000 hectares of maize and millet has been damaged and in Zimbabwe up to 130 000 hectares could be affected thus far.

The number of suspected cases of measles have increased in 2022 compared to the previous years. This surge in cases is linked to a decrease in measles vaccination coverage of children below five years in drought affected districts (Figure 4). Since epidemiological week 1 of 2022, a total of 17 093 suspected cases of measles were reported through the surveillance system for fever and rash used by the polio programme in drought-affected districts. However, the number of new measles cases reported has decreased by 29% from 302 in week 50 to 213 in week 51. This reduction is linked to scaling up of vaccination campaigns by outreach teams deployed by WHO in drought affected districts. Of the 17 093 suspected measles cases reported, 77% (13 090) are children below five years of age. ([WHO, 12 Jan 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3923365))

The number of suspected cases of measles reported through the AFP/Polio surveillance system in 2023 decreased by three-fold compared to the same period in 2022. This reduction in cases is linked to an increase in the number of children vaccinated mainly in IDP camps by WHO supported outreach teams that have scaled up the provision of integrated primary health care services including vaccination services to these camps. (Figure 4). A total of 3006 cases of measles were reported from week 1 to week 19 of 2023 of which 2090(69.5%) are children under 5. The regions reporting most cases are Bay (967), Banadir (930) and Lower juba (199). Of the 1170 blood samples collected from cases of fever and rash, 838 (71%) were tested positive for measles specific Immunoglobulin M(IgM). ([WHO, 16 Jul 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3982087))

As of 10 November, about 31,000 people are displaced in Region III (Central Luzon) by Typhoon Haima, which hit the Philippines on 19 October. Of the total number of displaced people, 3,600 people remain inside evacuation centres in the provinces of Tarlac, Bulacan and Pampanga. Nearly 270,000 houses were destroyed, mostly in Cagayan and Isabela provinces. The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) continues to lead the government’s transition to recovery, providing emergency shelter funds and cash-for-work programming to affected families. ([OCHA, 14 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1777546))

Preliminary official estimates indicated that, as of 4 November, about 400,000 hectares of paddy, maize and high value crops (such as mango, banana, papaya, cassava and vegetables) were adversely affected by both typhoons Haima and [Sarika](https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/37386), which hit in quick succession. The overall damage to the agriculture sector was estimated to be close to USD 234 million. However, the overall impact on 2016 cereal crops is expected to be limited. ([FAO, 16 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1786491/))

By mid-December, almost two months after Typhoon Haima struck, affected regions have shifted from emergency response to recovery. Housing, infrastructure and agricultural damage are some of the major concerns. At least 23 deaths were attributed to Typhoon Haima and more than 260,000 people were moved to evacuation centres. ([OCHA, 13 Dec 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1818639))

On 20 December, the IFRC revised its appeal. It is now seeking 2,007,914 Swiss francs (reduced from just under 3 million Swiss francs) to support the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) in delivering assistance and support to 29,210 people (increased from 20,000 people) affected by Typhoon Haima over 10 months. The operation will focus on health; water, sanitation and hygiene; shelter; food, nutrition, and livelihoods; disaster risk reduction and National Society capacity building. Major changes include the use of cash transfer programming in the recovery phase in support of shelter and livelihoods interventions. Relief operations have continued since the onset of the disaster, focusing on food and non-food items. However, the priority has now moved to support shelter and livelihoods recovery as two of the most significantly impacted sectors. ([IFRC, 20 Dec 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1829784))

The powerful Hurricane Matthew directly impacted Cuba during eight hours from late afternoon on October 4th until the early morning of October 5th, with a strength of category 4 hurricane according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. First estimates indicate that 1,079,000 people are affected, and that 176,000 people are isolated in the province of Guantánamo. ([UNCT, 5 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1724421))

In Haiti, media reports are emerging of more than 100 deaths by 6 October, as teams begin to reach isolated communities. UNOSAT analysis of the affected areas indicates more than 1 million people may have been affected by the hurricane-force winds and rain, while the Haitian Civil Protection Agency reports that 350,000 people need assistance.

The Haitian Red Cross Society set up an online platform for information management with support from the IFRC Information Management (IM) Team. This platform is built for information and documents dissemination: [Operation: Hurricane Matthew Dashboard](https://app.klipfolio.com/published/ec77978d9513651515591847f84e4e61/hurricane-matthew). Initially dedicated to common vulnerability analysis, monitoring process and evaluation for all members of the RCRCM, the platform evolved to serve operational and coordination purposes. The backend tool also helped to define the budget and human resources (stored job descriptions) for each sector. Furthermore, the sectors of intervention that have been retained for the recovery phase of the operation (Health, WASH, Shelter, and Livelihoods) are planned and will be implemented in an integrated manner.

As of 03 June, areas worst affected by the passage of Hurricane Matthew are likely to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) through June 2017. Starting in July, harvests of Printemps crops, associated seasonal declines in staple food prices, and agricultural labor income are expected to improve food security outcomes. Between June and September, most areas of the country will face Minimal (IPC Phase 1) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity outcomes, while certain households will remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in parts of the southern peninsula, upper Artibonite, and Sud-Est Department.

Niger: Rift Valley Fever Outbreak - Sep 2016,"The Ministry of Health, which officially declared the outbreak on 20 September, says 23 people have died from the virus and 60 people have been infected. Nearly all of those infected are pastoralists. There are also reports of significant livestock deaths from the virus, particularly cattle, sheep and camels. ([IFRC, 23 Sep 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1707881))

From 2 August to 22 September 2016, 64 human cases including 23 deaths have been reported in Tchintabaraden health district in Tahoua region. The area is mainly populated by nomadic stockbreeders.
Most of the cases are male (62.5%), and work as farmers or animal breeders. In the affected area, an epizootic outbreak is also reported among livestock during the same time duration, including deaths and abortions among cattle and small ruminants. ([WHO, 29 Sep 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1717126/))

The outbreak occurred in the districts of Tchintabaraden, Tassara and Abalak. All three in the Tahoua region. The majority of the affected population are nomadic pastoralists who have direct contact with blood or organs of the infected animals, or any other body fluid delivered from infected animals(milk). The larval mosquito bites and the blood-sucking flies (blood-feeding) can also transmit the virus. The population at risk are estimated at 124,337 so far. This number might increase due to the fact that the majority of the group at risk (pastoralists) are reluctant to seek medical assistance and are always on the move. Besides the medical assistance, the huge needs are in social mobilization, community awareness sessions, surveillance, detection of cases and referrals of suspected cases. ([IFRC, 1 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1717741))

With a total of 90 cases and 28 deaths reported between 2 August and 5 October 2016 from Tchintabaraden in Tahoua region, WHO indicates that there is a high risk of spread to neighboring countries given the prevailing security situation, population movement and limited public health
infrastructure in the affected areas. ([WHO, 5 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1748316/))

Sri Lanka: Drought - 2016-2017,"An estimated 520,000 people across eight provinces (Eastern, North Central, North Western, Northern, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Central and Western) were affected by drought as of 13 October 2016. The Government has allocated US$140,000 and 159 water trucks to 22 districts. Some 60 schools have been closed due to water shortages, affecting 26,000 children. ([OCHA, 17 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1739891/))

As of 17 January, an estimated 644,000 people across eight provinces were affected by drought and salt water intrusion over the previous four months. Batticaloa District in Eastern province was the worst affected with 302,000 people experiencing the effects of drought. The Government initiated water trucking in Batticaloa and took measures to import additional rice in the event the prolonged drought has a significant impact on food supplies. The President of Sri Lanka established a Task Force to coordinate the response. ([OCHA, 23 Jan 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1868904/))

Parts of the country received heavy rains in late January, causing floods in some areas. This will temporarily alleviate water shortages for human and animal use in some areas, but the damage done to the Maha crop is irreversible and there is continued concern for the subsequent Yala season due to the still very low water levels in reservoirs (73 major reservoirs stand at only 28% of their capacity). Based on historical trends, the combined production of staple crops foreseen from the two 2017 harvests is expected to result in the worst rice production levels in the last 10 years. ([WFP, 31 Jan 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1898859/))

Even if rainfall is received in the early months of the year, Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector is unlikely to make a full recovery in 2017. With much of the poor households concentrated in  rural areas and dependent on agriculture for access to income, and local production representing the bulk of food sources in the country, livelihood opportunities and food insecurity are only likely to worsen among the most vulnerable. ([ACAPS, 23 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1914683))

As of 3 March, an estimated 1.2 million people were affected by prolonged drought in 16 districts across Sri Lanka’s nine provinces. Kalutara District (Western Province) had the most people affected due to salinisation of the water supply. WASH, food security and nutrition, agricultural livelihoods and cash-for-work programmes have been identified as priority response activities.  ([OCHA, 6 Mar 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1929559/))

As of 19 March, more than one million people were affected by prolonged drought in 17 out of 25 districts of Sri Lanka. According to a joint household assessment, an estimated 900,000 people were identified as being in urgent need of food assistance, with 25,000 people severely food insecure. Food, water and sanitation, health and agriculture were urgent priority needs. ([OCHA, 20 Mar 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1950309/))

As of 5 April, 900,000 drought-affected people were classed as severely food insecure. An estimated 80,000 needed immediate support to mitigate the impact of the drought and 25,000 required urgent humanitarian assistance. The loss of two consecutive harvests due to poor rainfall has impacted food security and resilience. As a consequence of the poor Maha harvest, seeds for the Yala season are “seriously compromised.” This, coupled with water shortages, could exacerbate the situation if the Yala harvest is severely impacted as expected. ([OCHA, 10 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1982179/))

As of 21 April, a joint in-country drought response plan is currently being developed by the Humanitarian Country Team in consultation with the Ministry of Disaster Management. NGO consortium partners are supporting local authorities in providing water, sanitation and hygiene services and unconditional cash grants.

As of 20 August, more than 1.2 million people across 19 out of 25 districts remain affected by drought. Northern, North-Central and Eastern Provinces are reporting low levels of water for agricultural, drinking and household use. The failure of two harvests in 2017 has raised concerns for the food security and livelihoods of affected communities.

Despite the southwest monsoon in late May 2017, which triggered flooding and landslides in the country’s southwest provinces, country-wide drought conditions are ongoing, with the total affected population reaching more than two million people in early September. However, the figures reported by the Disaster Management Centre have now been reduced due to brief inter-monsoonal rains experienced in mid-September across various districts. These rains are unlikely to significantly alleviate the ongoing drought conditions that are predicted to continue in the coming weeks.

The outbreak of hepatitis E in the Salamat region of Chad continues to evolve, with one new district being affected. The potential of the outbreak to escalate is high given the prevailing predisposing factors. Only 25% of the 63,000 people in Am Timan, the epicenter of the outbreak, have access to clean and safe water. Meanwhile, about 30% of the 13,000 people in Aboudeïa have access to safe water.

The affected communities also have poor sanitation, commonly practicing free range open defecation. With these factors, in addition to the onset of rainy season expected soon, the risk of further spread of hepatitis E, as well as of cholera, remains very high. ([WHO, 14 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2005094))

In week 15 (week ending 16 April 2017), a total of 2,388 suspected cases of AWD/cholera were reported in Afar, Amhara and Somali regions of the country. While some decline has been observed in the trend in the last weeks [4,200 cases in week 14; 4,104 cases in week 13; 4,358 cases in week 12], it is still premature to deduce overall improvement in the situation on the ground, especially with the weak surveillance system. Somali region remains the most affected, accounting for 99% of the new cases reported in the reporting week. On 20 April 2017, WHO elevated the outbreak of AWD/cholera and the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia to grade 3 emergency.

Eighty-eight percent of the cases and 94% of the deaths were reported in Somali Region alone. ([WHO, 17 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2126064))

A 27 per cent increase in the number of [AWD] cases was reported nationwide last week, mainly due to spikes in new cases reported in Amhara and Tigray regions and a resurgence of the outbreak in Afar region where community transmission of the disease is widespread. Currently, the major risk factors for the spread of the outbreak are holy water sites where large numbers of Christian pilgrims congregate from around the country, especially in Amhara and Tigray, and seasonal mobility of daily laborers to commercial farms. The high risk for further spread of the AWD outbreak continues due to the degradation of health determinants on the back drop of overburdened local health systems, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and internal and cross-border movements. ([OCHA, 03 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2200974))

Recurrent cholera outbreaks have been reported in the drought-affected districts of Somalia since 2022, with no interruption in transmission in Banadir region since 2017. The number of cholera cases reported in drought and flood affected districts have increased in 2023 compared to the same time over the past two years (Figure 1). This increase is attributed to a higher proportion of people with limited access to safe water and uncontrolled cross border movement in Somalia and neighboring countries triggered by drought.  Since epidemiological week 1 of 2023, a total of 15 171 cases of suspected cholera and 42 deaths (Case Fatality Rate 0.3%) were reported from 25 drought and four flood-affected districts of which 8 153 (53.7%) cases were children under 5, 7860 (51.8%) were women and 7197(47.4%) were severe cases.([WHO, 29 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4018549))

The UN, together with humanitarian partners, have launched an [appeal](https://reliefweb.int/node/1494316) for US$72.7 million to assist 350,000 of the most affected persons, for an initial 3-month period. ([OCHA, 24 Apr 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1496301))

The human toll of the earthquake is registered as 668 deaths, eight missing people and 6,274 people with severe injuries. More than 230,000 people were wounded and more than one million people were directly or indirectly affected by the earthquake. Approximately 35,000 homes are classified as destroyed or damaged and 140,000 people lack adequate housing. The government initially declared a state of emergency in six provinces which was extended until mid-December in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Manabí. The severe aftershocks of 19 May and 10 July in the same provinces produced further humanitarian needs, particularly for increased actions in psychosocial support and community-based disaster risk reduction. ([IFRC, 23 Dec 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1834959))

By mid-October 2016, about 16,000 people were still staying in shelters and displacement sites. ([OCHA, 13 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1739411))

On 19 December, another earthquake, of 5.8 magnitude this time, hit the northwest part of Ecuador in Esmeraldas province with epicenter in Atacames. Subsequently, 144 aftershocks took place in the area. More than 4,000 people have been affected (including 3 people dead,) while 145 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Local working groups were immediately activated in order to respond, with one new official IDP camp settled, and 15 additional informal shelters set up, while heavy rains in the area hamper humanitarian response. The State of Emergency has been extended to 13 March 2017 in Manabí and Esmeraldas provinces. ([UNICEF, 16 Jan 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1874099))

In Mid-March 2017, the State of Exception was extended for another month in Manabí and Esmeraldas provinces. ([Gov't Ecuador, 14 Mar 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1944559))

A year after the earthquake, through a multi-sectorial emergency response, UNICEF achieved, among other positive results, the provision of safe drinking water (77,000 beneficiaries), sanitation infrastructure (44,000) and hygiene promotion (68,000), as well as the establishment of temporary spaces for education and protection (with a capacity for 13,290 children), and the provision of educational/recreational materials (just over 34,000 children benefited). ([UNICEF, 12 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1986809))
On the other hand, UNDP stated that its current aim is to improve coordination, flow of adequate information and standardization of procedures for an orderly and effective response that meets the existing needs. To that aim, it has provided technical experts for demolition and environmental management of rubble throughout the country, provinces and municipalities, among others. ([UNDP, 15 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2032459))    

As regards other response actions a year after, one key result achieved since the time of the earthquake includes the action brought before the Constitutional Court of Ecuador to request the recognition of the right to adequate and decent housing, regardless of the possession of a formal land title. The Ecuador Red Cross has supported communities to fulfill the administrative and legal processes necessary to achieve security of housing, land and property for people affected by disasters. ([IFRC, 9 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2068004))   

On 30 June, an earthquake measuring 6.3 struck off the coast of Manabí, a province where approximately 90 per cent of the population live in poverty. Manabí is still recovering from the effects of the April 2016 earthquake and prolonged rainfall in 2017. Since then, there have been 58 aftershocks, and more are forecasted for the coming weeks.

Morocco: Cold Wave - Feb 2016,"A cold wave has affected Morocco on Saturday 27 February 2016, caused by a polar air mass flow passing from the North Pole to Europe and North Africa, and has generated westerly winds that has brought extreme and exceptionally low temperatures as per the Communications Department at the National Directorate of Meteorology. 

The regions of the Middle Atlas and the north of the High Atlas and the neighbouring plains witnessed severe thunderstorms, while significant snow fell over the High and Middle Atlas, the Rif and the highlands of eastern Morocco... 

Given the severity of the situation, local authorities and relevant departments have mobilized all human and material resources and have been operating since Friday to assist the most affected population. The Moroccan Red Crescent was among the first responders to bring help to the most affected people. Details of the operations carried out so far is described in the next section.

Through this DREF, the Moroccan Red Crescent will intervene in three regions to assist 1,500 families (7,500 beneficiaries) providing food and non-food items to the most affected women, men boys and girls. Those regions heavily affected by the cold wave are: Oriental, Tadla Azilal and in four localities in Fes Taza. [(IFRC, 3 Mar 2016)](https://reliefweb.int/node/1422501)

As a result of the exceptional weather conditions, several illnesses have been recorded among affected communities including rheumatism, flu, cough, throat pain, and skin conditions – mainly caused by the lack of suitable clothes to protect from the cold. Moroccan Red Crescent has been offering medical consultations at its health posts and so far, more than 3,000 people have benefited from these services.

IOM has also responded to these recent disasters affecting the Highlands region. In Jiwaka the Wagi valley has flooded and numerous landslides have occurred because of heavy rains. It is estimated that five thousand households are affected by flooding or landslides. One of the biggest concerns remains food security. Crops that can take nine months to mature are being washed away by heavy rain. In the dry season communities planted close to rivers in the hopes of speeding up the drought recovery, but now these much needed crops have been swept away by the heavy rain.

IOM is the only international disaster relief organisation with a permanent base in Jiwaka.

As of 7 April, a total of 664 cases and 12 deaths had been reported in Lusaka.

MSF is working in close collaboration with the Zambian Ministry of Health and WHO to carry out the vaccination campaign, which is expected to last for two weeks....In Lusaka, around 1.2 million people live in overcrowded ‘informal settlements’ that are at risk of cholera each rainy season. This year, the rainy season was delayed, causing boreholes to dry up and forcing the population to use unprotected shallow wells. When the rains came, floodwaters mixed with overfull pit latrines, creating rivers and lakes of contaminated water that people were forced to wade through. This has created the ideal environment for a large-scale cholera outbreak. ([MSF, 9 Apr 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1473621))

Since mid-November 2015, extensive rainfall in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has led to flooding across the country. On 6 December, the heavy rains led to the overflow of the N'djili River causing flooding in the Debonhome, KingabuaNdanu, KingabuaPécheur and Salongo neighbourhoods of the capital Kinshasa, affecting 10,560 people (2,112 families) and resulting in 31 deaths and numerous injuries. The Processing Centre of the Water Distribution Authority serving Kinshasa along the river N'djili was damaged, reducing the available safe water supply.

As of 10 February 2016, the waters had receded in the Debonhomme and Salongo neighbourhoods, however the neighbourhoods of KingabuaPecheur and KingabuaNdanu are still flooded, obliging the population of these two neighbourhoods to use canoes as means of transportation.
